Report Card Eligible and Responsible Entity
Definition
A responsible entity is a school or district that a student/enrollment/observation is assigned to for the
purposes of reporting in the Report Card. The “responsible entity” was developed to facilitate communication
about how to calculate Report Card Metrics and to document the distinction between how metrics are
calculated for the Report Card and how they are calculated for the use in Summative Designations (which uses
“accountable school”).

A Student is assigned to a Responsible Entity (either Home or Serving). Some students are assigned to a
responsible school and district while others, for serving-school specific metrics, are assigned to a responsible
district only. One group of students are only reported at the State level.
•  Responsible School is the school used for calculating all Report Card metrics. In most cases, a student’s

responsible school is their home school. Paris Cooperative High School and Bismark Henning Rossville Alvin
Cooperative High School are exceptions. There are also specific metrics where the responsible school is
based on a student’s serving school (e.g. enrollment, Climate Survey participation).

•  Responsible District is the district used for calculating all Report Card metrics. It is either the parent district

of the responsible school or the parent district of a student’s home school in cases where the
student’s serving school is a special education cooperative, special education private facility, nonpublic
school, or a miscellaneous payee. Students who have no responsible school may be included in district-
level calculations for their responsible district.

Data Display
Definition
Within the Report Card, data redaction rules are applied to various metrics.

Guidance Citation
State Statute/Guidance: N/A
Federal Statute/Guidance: FERPA https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html

Business Rules
•  Redaction rules apply to Ed. Preview, Report Card, and Public Data Set, but do not apply to DRVT.
•  Do not display value or “Redacted” for a percentage or ratio metric if the denominator is 0 or does not

exist, display “No Data Available” instead.

•  Except for Accountability metrics, for any metric where the count is less than or equal to 9, then no data

will be displayed for that metric.

o  For a count metric that is not the numerator of a percentage calculation, display “*” (on PDS) or

“Redacted” (on IIRC) if the count is between 1 and 9; display blank (on PDS) or “No Data” (on IIRC)
if the count is 0.

o  For a percentage metric, display “*” (on PDS) or “Redacted” (on IIRC) (both numerator and

o

percentage) if the numerator is less than 10 and the denominator exists.
In the case where there are multiple percentages for a metric that are based on the same
denominator, such as performance level percentages for IAR and Sped EE percentages, the
numerator of each percentage is not considered for redaction, instead redaction only takes place
when the denominator for the multiple percentages is less than 10.

o  For IAR, SAT, DLM, and ISA, proficiency rates are only redacted based on the denominator.
•  For Summative Designation Metadata Indicator Components, no data will be displayed for a metric if the

denominator is less than 20.

o  Display “*” (on PDS) or “Redacted” (on IIRC) if the denominator exists and is less than 20.

•  No redaction rules are applied to State level metrics
•  No redaction rules are applied to any Teacher metrics at the State, District, or School level
•  No redaction rules are applied to any Administrator metrics at the State, District, or School level
•  No redaction rules are applied to any Financial metrics at the State, District, or School level except for per-

pupil expenditure.

•  No redaction rules are applied to any External Data Collection metrics at the State, District, or School level
•  For a metric that the default grade range of an entity (based on School or District Type in the table below)
do not meet the metric’s default grade range requirement, only display the data (and UI shell)  if it is not
redacted after applying the redaction rules.

o  Example: 9th Grade on Track for a Middle/Junior High School Type Entity, display data (and UI shell)

if there are data for this metric based on 10 or more students.

•  For a metric that the default grade range of an entity (based on School or District Type in the table below)

does meet the metric’s default grade range requirement, but the data are redacted after applying
redaction rules, only display the UI shell if this metric is only based on less than 10 students.

o  Example 9th grade on Track for a High School Type Entity, but there are only eight eligible 9th

grader students for this metric’s data point, so display UI shell only and redact the data
•  For a grade of a metric that the grade served of an entity (based on Report Card Grades Table Below ) does
not meet the metric’s grade requirement, only display the value of the grade if it is not redacted after
applying redaction rules.

Page 15

o  Example: ISA for a High School Type Entity, display grade 5 or 8 data (and UI shell) if there is data

for this metric based on 10 or more students.

FRL and IEP) that has less than 10 (including 0) Fall enrollments.

▪  For Gender, Race and Grade bands, if only one subgroup was redacted by the prior step and
there are other subgroups with incident count greater than 0, redact the one with the next
lowest enrollment count so that users cannot subtract counts from the total to reveal
redacted counts.

Proficiency Rate ELA, Math and Science - All Tests
Definition
The federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requires states to assess their learning standards for
English/Language Arts (ELA), Math, and Science. Each state may also have a general assessment for the
majority of its students, and an alternate assessment for the one percent of students with the most
significant cognitive disabilities.

The “All Test Proficiency” measure is the proficiency rate for students combining all tests. A rate is calculated
for ELA, Math, and Science at the elementary and high school levels.

The “All Test Federal (95% Rule) Proficiency Rate” measure is calculated, when relevant using the 95%
Participation Rate denominator.  As relevant, a rate is calculated for ELA, Math, and Science at the elementary
and high school levels.

Guidance Citation
State Statute/Guidance: Illinois School Code 105 ILCS 5/2-3.64a-5;
Federal Statute/Guidance: ED Facts E- MAPS Assessment Metadata Survey;
https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-114publ95/pdf/PLAW-114publ95.pdf

Business Rules

•  ELA, Math, and Science rates for the “All Student” population are computed and displayed.
•  The testing enrollment is defined in the Participation metric.
•  The demographics (Race, Gender, and the Program Indicators) are disaggregated at the

entity level (school, district, or state level) and at the grade level.

•  The source for the IAR, SAT, ISA, and DLM-AA calculation is SIS Assessment Correction and Score

records.

•  For IAR, SAT, ISA, and DLM-AA, the grade is the grade at time of testing from the Correction record.
•  See the Student Groups business rules for more information on how the table is populated.

•  This table is populated as follows:

•  Race, Gender, first year in the US, grade, IDEA Services (IEP) indicator, Alternate

indicator, EL indicator are typically derived from assessment correction records where
available, and if no assessment correction record is available, then the SIS student
demographic data from the exited student enrollment is used.
IEP, EL and other student demographic indicators in the Student Metrics table are
determined using logic defined in the Student Groups business rules document.

•

•  We will include any changes to demographics data in the correction records unless IDEA
Services (IEP) indicator, or Alternate Assessment indicator.  We will use the grade at
time of testing from the correction record for reporting Assessment metrics.

•  All assessment proficiency rates are calculated for the responsible entity as defined in the Responsible

Entity business rules.

•  High School: Grades are 9 through 12

•  Use SAT and DLM-AA scores for ELA and Math

•

Levels 3 and 4 are proficient for SAT and DLM-AA (Grade 11 and 12 students who have a
valid score)

Page 19

•  For ELA and Math, Grade 9 and Grade 10 are excluded from proficiency rates by

subject and test and should be ignored for inclusion.

•  Use ISA and DLM-AA scores for Science

•

Levels 3 and 4 are proficient for DLM-AA (grade 11 and 12)

•  For Science, Grade 9 and Grade 10 are excluded for DLM-AA and should be

ignored for inclusion.

•

Level 3 and 4 are proficient for ISA (grade 11)

•  For Science, only Grade 11 is included for ISA.

•  Elementary School: Grades are 3 through 8

•  Use IAR and DLM-AA scores for ELA and Math.

•
•

Levels 4 and 5 are proficient for IAR (grades 3 through 8).
Levels 3 and 4 are proficient for DLM-AA (grades 3 through 8).

•  Use ISA and DLM-AA for Science.

•
•

Level 3 and 4 are proficient for ISA (grades 5 and 8)
Levels 3 and 4 are proficient for DLM-AA (grades 5 and 8).

•  Note for SY2023 and forward:

•

Invalid records and suppressed content areas should not be reported in the numerators of
participation and achievement assessment files. Invalid includes records that were not assigned
to students as well as those with missing enrollments, outside of testing window, outside of
grade levels tested, etc.

•  Proficiency Rate Numerator

•  Number of students who are proficient in either ELA, Math, or Science (IAR level 4 or level 5;

SAT level 3 or level 4; DLM-AA level 3 or level 4; ISA level 3 and 4)

•  Proficiency Rate Denominator

•  For IAR, SAT, ISA, and DLM-AA, apply the “First Year in U.S. School” indicator first.
•  Apply the “First Year in US” indicator check first. Please note that the EL indicator must also be

“yes” for the following conditions to apply:

•

•

If a student’s First Year in U.S. School indicator is “yes” and the EL indicator is “yes”, has
score, the student is not included in proficiency denominator and not included in the
proficiency numerator
If a student's First Year in U.S. School indicator is “yes” and the EL indicator is “yes”, has
no score, the student is not included in proficiency denominator and not included in the
proficiency numerator

•  The denominator for Proficiency Rate is derived and will be:

•  Total number of students with valid scores excluding all students with suppressed scores

•  Rules for multiple valid records:

•

If multiple valid records with same enrollment ID with both records with complete score
we will report only the record with the lesser value scoreID (for earliest test date) for
proficiency denominator at the respective district

•  At district level, if multiple valid records for a student exist with different enrollment

ID and different responsible districts, we will report only the record with the lesser value
scoreID (for earliest test date) for proficiency denominator at the respective district
•  At state level, if multiple valid records for a student exist with different enrollment

ID and different responsible districts, we will report only the record with the lesser value
scoreID (for earliest test date) for proficiency denominator

•  Federal (95% Rule) Proficiency Rate: The following rule applies for each subject level ELA, Math,

and Science (this does not apply to the test level):

Page 20

•  For any school or district where the denominator for Proficiency Rate uses “95% of the
Participation Rate” we must calculate and display both Proficiency Rate using the two
different denominators in each calculation “Total number of students with valid scores
excluding all students with suppressed scores” and “”95% of Participation Rate
denominator”) and indicate which calculation was used (meaning the “95% of the
Participation Rate”)

•  Proficiency Rate for IAR, SAT, ISA, and DLM-AA: The table below indicates whether a record is included

in the numerator for calculating Proficiency Rate.

•  Note:

•  SAT Only: For Suppression 01, RNVTA 22 applies to ELA and Math
•  SAT Only: In the RARE cases when a student has responses in only one content area but

not the other, we need to:

•  When ELA participation indicator = NO and Math participation indicator = YES,

we apply Suppression 02 and RNVTA 19 (suppresses minimum score of 200 only
in ELA that College Board auto-generates and hurts participation rate only for
ELA).

•  When ELA participation indicator = YES and Math participation indicator = NO,

we apply Suppression 03 and RNVTA 19 (suppresses minimum score of 200 only
in MATH that College Board auto-generates and hurts participation rate only for
MATH).

Proficiency Rate ELA, Math, and Science – DLM-AA
Definition
“Dynamic Learnings Maps – Alternative Assessments (DLM-AA)” offers students with the most significant
cognitive disabilities a way to show what they know and can do in a manner which differs from the
traditional multiple-choice tests. Assessments are based on a learning map, which is a map that shows
different paths a student might take to learn new academic skills. Results of the assessments help teachers to
plan individualized experiences for each student by creating lessons and activities that are appropriate for a
student’s needs and abilities.

“DLM-AA Proficiency” has four levels of performance which are:
•  Level 4: The student demonstrates advanced understanding of and ability to apply targeted content

knowledge and skills (considered proficient)

•  Level 3: The student’s understanding of and ability to apply content knowledge and skills represented is at

target (considered proficient)

•  Level 2: The student’s understanding of and ability to apply targeted content knowledge and skills is

approaching the target

•  Level 1: The student demonstrates emerging understanding of and ability to apply content knowledge and

skills

Business Rules
•  ELA, Math, and Science rates for the “All Student” population are computed and displayed.
•  The testing enrollment is defined in the Participation metric.
•  The demographics (Race, Gender, and the Program Indicators) are disaggregated at the

entity level (school, district, or state level) and at the grade level.

•  The source for the calculation is the DLM-AA Correction and Score records.
•  The grade is the grade at time of testing from the Correction record.
•  See the Student Groups business rules for more information on how the table is populated.

o  This table is populated as follows:

▪  Race, Gender, first year in the US, IDEA indicator, alternate assessment indicator, and EL
indicator are typically derived from assessment correction records where available, and if
no assessment correction record is available, then the SIS student demographic data from
the exited student enrollment is used.
IEP, EL and other student demographic indicators in the Student Metrics table are
determined using logic defined in the Student Groups business rules document.

▪

▪  We will include any changes to demographics data in the correction records.  We will use
the grade at time of testing from the correction record for reporting Assessment metrics

•  All assessment proficiency rates are calculated for the responsible entity as defined in the Responsible

Entity business rules.

•  DLM-AA has a student record with an ELA, Math, and Science score.

Page 25

o  For ELA, Math, and Science, Grade 9 and Grade 10 are excluded from proficiency rates.
o  For ELA, Math, and Science, Grade 12 students who have a valid score will be reported with Grade

11 students.

•  The proficiency rate is calculated for ELA, Math, and Science.

o

If a student is in a Performance Level of 3 or 4, then they are considered Proficient.

•  Each subgroup is calculated the same way.
•  There are no given Scale Scores for DLM-AA, just performance levels.
•

 Note for SY2023 and forward:

o

Invalid records should not be reported in the numerators of participation and achievement
assessment files. Invalid includes records that were not assigned to students as well as those with
missing enrollments, outside of testing window, outside of grade levels tested, etc.

•  Proficiency Rate Numerator

o  Number of students who are proficient in ELA, Math, or Science (level 3 or level 4)

•  Proficiency Rate Denominator

o  Apply the “First Year in US” indicator check first. Please note that the EL indicator must also be

“yes” for the following conditions to apply:

▪

▪

If a student’s First Year in U.S. School indicator is “yes” and the EL indicator is “yes”, has
score, the student is not included in proficiency denominator and not included in the
proficiency numerator
If a student's First Year in U.S. School indicator is “yes” and the EL indicator is “yes”, has no
score, the student is not included in proficiency denominator and not included in the
proficiency numerator

o  The denominator for Proficiency Rate is derived and will be:

▪  Total number of students with valid scores excluding all students with suppressed scores

o  Rules for multiple records:

▪

If multiple records with same enrollment ID with both records with complete score we will
report only the record with the lesser value scoreID (for earliest test date) for proficiency
denominator at the respective district

▪  At district level, if multiple records for a student exist with different enrollment ID and

different responsible districts, we will report only the record with the lesser value scoreID
(for earliest test date) for proficiency denominator at the respective district

▪  At state level, if multiple records for a student exist with different enrollment ID and

different responsible districts, we will report only the record with the lesser value scoreID
(for earliest test date) for proficiency denominator

•  The table below indicates whether a record is included in the numerator for calculating Proficiency Rate.

Proficiency Rate ELA and Math – SAT
Definition
The SAT is accepted by all U.S. colleges and is intended to determine a student’s level of college
readiness in the academic subjects of English/Language Arts and Math. Illinois uses the SAT with Essay as
the regular state assessment for high school accountability. Performance Levels that determine
proficiency are attributed to only the ELA and mathematics section scores.

SAT Proficiency has four Performance Levels:
•  Level 4: Exceeds standards (considered proficient)
•  Level 3: Meets standards (considered proficient)
•  Level 2: Approaching standards
•  Level 1: Partially meets standards

Scale Score ranges associated with the four performance levels can be found on the ISBE SAT webpage:
https://www.isbe.net/Documents/SAT-Performance-Levels-Chart.pdf

The proficiency rate is calculated for ELA and Math.

Proficiency Rate Science – ISA
Definition
The Illinois Science Assessment (ISA) tests are designed to measure performance against the Illinois Learning
Standards in science.  The tests require students to apply their science skills to answering questions. The
science tests are given to students enrolled in grades 5, 8 and 11. ISA tests are in compliance with federal
testing requirements.

“ISA Proficiency” has the below levels of performance: (for 2022 and beyond after Standards setting takes
place.)  will be confirmed summer 2021 after Standards Setting takes place):
•  Level 4 ‘Exemplary’ – Work at this level is of exceptional quality.  It is both thorough and accurate.  It

exceeds the standard.  It shows a sophisticated application of knowledge and skills.

•  Level 3 ‘Proficient’ – Work at this level meets the standard.  It is acceptable work that demonstrates

application of essential knowledge and skills.  Minor errors or omissions do not detract from the overall
quality.

•  Level 2 ‘Developing’ – Work at this level does not meet the standard.  It shows basic, but inconsistent

application of knowledge and skills.  Minor errors or omissions detract from the overall quality.  Your work
needs further development.

•  Level 1 ‘Emerging’ – Work at this level shows a partial application of knowledge and skills.  It is superficial
(lacks depth), fragmented or incomplete and needs considerable development.  Your work contains errors
or omissions.

Proficiency Rate and Student Growth Percentile ELA and Math – IAR
Definition
The Illinois Assessment of Readiness (IAR) is a federally required measure of students’ mastery of the Illinois
Learning Standards in English/Language Arts (ELA) and Math in grades 3 through 8, and their readiness for
what’s next.  IAR results are also used to measure student growth for school and district accountability.

IAR Proficiency has five levels of performance, which are:
•  Level 5: Exceeded expectations (considered proficient)
•  Level 4: Met expectations (considered proficient)
•  Level 3: Approached expectations
•  Level 2: Partially met expectations
•  Level 1: Did not yet meet expectations

“Student Growth Percentile (SGP)” is a measure of student growth that compares a student’s performance
over time to that of their academic peers (e.g., students in Illinois who have the same scale score in the prior
year). It includes the current year score and up to two prior years’ scores allowing the growth percentile
calculation to represent a true growth trend and not just movement up and down from year to year. Individual
student growth percentiles range from 1 to 99. A score of 50 represents average or expected growth.

o  Cohort SGP:

▪  The cohort SGP compares a student’s assessment score this year to all other Illinois

students (in the same grade and same subject) who had the same scale score last year. The
state mean will always be 50 in a cohort SGP calculation.

o  Baseline SGP:

▪  The baseline SGP compares a student’s assessment score this year to all other Illinois

students (in the same grade and same subject) who had the same scale score in a specified
previous baseline year. A state mean above 50 in a baseline SGP calculation means students
overall grew more this year than in the prior baseline year.

The Scale Score to Performance level conversion for IAR can be found at:

Business Rules
•  ELA and Math rates for the “All Student” population are computed and displayed.
•  The testing enrollment is defined in the Participation metric.
•  The demographics (Race, Gender, and the Program Indicators) are disaggregated at the

entity level (school, district, or state level) and at the grade level.
•  The source for the calculation is IAR Correction and Score records.
•  The grade is the grade at time of testing from the Correction record.
•  See the Student Groups business rules for more information on how the table is populated.

o  This table is populated as follows:

▪  Race, Gender, first year in the US, IDEA indicator, alternate assessment indicator, and EL
indicator are typically derived from assessment correction records where available, and if

Page 39

no assessment correction record is available, then the SIS student demographic data from
the exited student enrollment is used.  For SY2024, assessment correction data will be
available and SY2024 report card will use assessment correction data to determine student
demographics.
IEP, EL and other student demographic indicators in the Student Metrics table are
determined using logic defined in the Student Groups business rules document.

▪

▪  We will include any changes to demographics data in the correction records.  We will use
the grade at time of testing from the correction record for reporting Assessment metrics.

•  All assessment proficiency rates are calculated for the responsible entity as defined in the Responsible

Entity business rules.
IAR has student records for both ELA and Math.

•
•  The proficiency rate is calculated for both ELA and Math.

o

If a student is in a Performance Level of 4 or 5 then they are considered Proficient.

•  Each subgroup is calculated the same way.
•  Note for SY2023 and forward:

o

Invalid records should not be reported in the numerators of participation and achievement
assessment files. Invalid includes records that were not assigned to students as well as those with
missing enrollments, outside of testing window, outside of grade levels tested, etc.

•  Proficiency Rate Numerator

o  Number of students who are proficient in either ELA or Math (level 4 or level 5)

•  Proficiency Rate Denominator (for 2022 and forward)

o  Apply the “First Year in US” indicator check first.  Please note that the EL indicator must also be

“yes” for the following conditions to apply:

▪

▪

If a student’s First Year in U.S. School indicator is “yes” and the EL indicator is “yes”, has
score, the student is not included in proficiency denominator and not included in the
proficiency numerator.
If a student's First Year in U.S. School indicator is “yes” and the EL indicator is “yes”, has no
score, the student is not included in proficiency denominator and not included in the
proficiency numerator.

o  The denominator for Proficiency Rate for assessments is derived and will be:

▪  Total number of students with valid scores excluding all students with suppressed scores

o  Rules for multiple records:

▪

If multiple records with same enrollment ID with both records with complete score we will
report only the record with the lesser value scoreID (for earliest test date) for proficiency
denominator at the respective district

▪  At district level, if multiple records for a student exist with different enrollment ID and

different responsible districts, we will report only the record with the lesser value scoreID
(for earliest test date) for proficiency denominator at the respective district

▪  At state level, if multiple records for a student exist with different enrollment ID and

different responsible districts, we will report only the record with the lesser value scoreID
(for earliest test date) for proficiency denominator

•  The table below indicates whether a record is included in the numerator for calculating Proficiency Rate.

•  Student Growth Percentile (SGP):

o  Starting on the 2023 Report Card, ISBE will display both ‘cohort’ and ‘baseline’ data
o  Student Growth Percentile (SGP) is calculated at the entity level (School, District, and State).
o  The SGP is the average of individual student growth percentiles at the school, district, or state.
o
In order to calculate an SGP, the student would need to test in the same subject in the current
reporting year and the previous school year, in a standard test to test progression group (e.g.,
Grade 3 to 4, Grade 4 to 5).

o  SGP is disaggregated at Race, Programs IEP, EL, and Low Income.
o  SGP is disaggregated by the proficiency levels.
o

Individual SGPs are calculated from the vendor and are transmitted to ISBE. ISBE only calculates
aggregate SGPs.
Include students in the Proficiency Denominator that have SGP in the vendor file.

Business Rules
•  Each subject (ELA, Math, and Science) and applicable test (IAR, SAT, DLM-AA, and ISA) are reported.
•  See the Student Groups business rules for more information on how the table is populated.

o  This table is populated as follows:

▪  Race, Gender and program indicators are typically derived from assessment correction

records where available, and if no assessment correction record is available, then the SIS
student demographic data from the exited student enrollment is used.
IEP, EL and other student demographic indicators in the Student Metrics table are
determined using logic defined in the Student Groups business rules document.

▪

▪  We will include any changes to demographics data in the correction records.  We will use
the demographics at time of testing from the correction record for reporting Assessment
metrics.

•  All assessment participation rates and no participation rates are calculated for the responsible entity as

defined in the Responsible Entity business rules

•  Note: For 2024, any grade 12 students who were identified to be assessed and has a valid score or RNVTA,

data should be included in any participation rate calculations.

•  For each assessment type, subject, and student group, the assessment no participation rate is calculated

as:

o

(Sum of students with a “N” indicator in the “Include in Participation Numerator” column) ÷ (Sum
of students with a “Y” indicator in the “Include in Participation Denominator” column) * 100

o  Note for 2024 All Tests Participation Denominator

▪

▪

If multiple records exist with the same enrollment ID but there is no score for either
enrollment record, we will select a distinct record for the participation denominator
If multiple records exist with the same enrollment ID with a complete score but no score
record, we will select the enrollment record with score for participation denominator
▪  At district level, if multiple records for a student exist with different enrollment ID and

different responsible districts, we will report both records for participation denominator at
their respective districts

Page 44

▪  At state level, if multiple records for a student exist with different enrollment ID and
different responsible districts, we will report only distinct students for participation
denominator

▪  At state level, for student group reporting (not total), if multiple records for a student exist
with different enrollment ID and different demographic or program ID across the multiple
records, we will report:

•

•

•

If both records are NULL for scale score, we will report demographic or program ID
based on smallest enrollment ID record
If both records have a valid scale score (and neither are suppressed), we will report
demographic or program ID based on smallest enrollment ID record
If only one record has a scale score, we will report demographic or program ID based
on the record with the scale score

•  Note for SY2023 and forward:

o

Invalid records and suppressed content scores should not be reported in the numerators of
participation and achievement assessment files. Invalid includes records that were not assigned to
students as well as those with missing enrollments, outside of testing window, outside of grade
levels tested, etc.

•  Participation Rate for SAT with Essay, IAR, ISA, and DLM-AA:

o  The table below indicates whether a record is included in the numerator and/or denominator for

calculating Participation Rate.

o  Note:

▪  Apply the “First Year in U.S. School” indicator check first.  Please note that the EL indicator

must also be “yes” for the following conditions to apply:

•

•

If student has First Year in the U.S. School indicator “yes” and EL indicator is “yes”,
has scale score, the student is included in the numerator and denominator.
If student has First Year in the U.S. School indicator “yes” and EL indicator is “yes”,
has no scale score, the student is not included in the numerator, but included in the
denominator.

▪

▪

▪

▪

If a student who assessed for SAT with Essay has suppression 01, RNVTA 22 for ELA and
Math, the student is not included in the numerator and denominator for participation.
If a student who assessed for SAT with Essay with ELA suppression code 02 and RNVTA of
19, and has a math score, the student is included in the numerator and denominator for
math and only in the denominator for ELA.
If a student who assessed for SAT with Essay with math suppression code 03 and RNVTA of
19, and has an ELA score, the student is included in the numerator and denominator for ELA
and only in the denominator for math.
If a student does not have a valid score and no RNVTA, the student will be included in only
the denominator for participation.

National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
Definition
Reading Grades 4 and 8
The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as "The Nation's Report Card," is the
only nationally representative and continuing assessment of what American’s students know and can do in
various subjects.

NAEP does not provide scores for individual students or schools instead, it offers results regarding subject-
matter achievement, instructional experiences, and school environment for populations of students (e.g.,
fourth-graders) and student groups of those populations (e.g., female students, Hispanic students). NAEP
results are based on a sample of student populations of interest.

National NAEP reports information for the nation and specific geographic regions of the country. It includes
students drawn from both public and nonpublic schools and reports results for student achievement at grades
4, 8, and 12.

These assessments follow the Frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB),
and use the latest advances in assessment methodology. For example, NAEP assessments include many
constructed-response questions and questions that require calculators and other materials. Innovative types
of questions have been used in assessments such as the arts (theatre, music, and visual arts) and science to
measure students' ability to perform hands-on tasks.

Since 1990, NAEP assessments have also been conducted on the state level. Participating states receive
assessment results that report on the performance of students in that state. In its content, the state
assessment is identical to the assessment conducted nationally. However, because the national NAEP samples
were not, and are not currently designed to support the reporting of accurate and representative state-level
results, separate representative samples of students are selected for each participating jurisdiction/state.

Illinois’ history of NAEP participation is available at:

L&fs=Grade&st=MN&year=2019R3&sg=Gender%3A+Male+vs.+Female&sgv=Difference&ts=Single+Year&sfj=N
P

In addition to the assessments, NAEP coordinates special educational studies related to assessment. Ongoing
projects include the High School Transcript Study and a Technology-Based Assessment project designed to
explore the use of technology, especially the use of the computer as a tool to enhance the quality and
efficiency assessments.

Reading Grades 4 and 8
•  The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading assessment is given every two years to

students at grades 4 and 8, and approximately every four years at grade 12. NAEP 2021 was postponed to
2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The assessment measures reading comprehension by asking
students to read selected grade-appropriate materials and answer questions based on what they have
read. The results present a broad view of students’ reading knowledge, skills, and performance over time.
The most recent assessment was given in 2022 to approximately 2,600 Illinois students in grade 4 and
2,800 Illinois students in grade 8.

Page 52

•  The National Assessment Governing Board oversees the development of NAEP frameworks that describe
the specific knowledge and skills to be assessed in each subject and how the assessment questions should
be designed and scored. The development of the NAEP reading framework was guided by scientifically
based reading research. The framework defines reading as a dynamic cognitive process that involves
understanding written text, developing and interpreting meaning, and using meaning as appropriate to the
type of text. The framework also guides the types of texts included in the assessment and specifies
cognitive targets for assessment questions. The same framework that has guided assessment development
since 2009 was used to guide development of the 2017, 2019, and 2022 digitally based assessments.

Math Grades 4 and 8
•  The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) mathematics assessment is given every two years
to students at grades 4 and 8, and approximately every four years at grade 12. NAEP 2021 was postponed
to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The assessment measures both mathematics knowledge and the
students’ ability to apply their knowledge in problem-solving situations. The results present a broad view
of students’ mathematics knowledge, skills, and performance over time. The most recent mathematics
assessment was given in 2022 to approximately 2,800 Illinois students in grade 4 and 2,800 Illinois
students in grade 8.

•  The National Assessment Governing Board oversees the development of NAEP frameworks that describe
the specific knowledge and skills to be assessed in each subject and how the assessment questions should
be designed and scored. The NAEP mathematics assessment framework specifies five broad content areas
and three levels of mathematical complexity. The 2009 mathematics framework for grades 4 and 8 is
similar to earlier frameworks that guided previous mathematics assessments.

•  The mathematics framework defines five broad content areas, three levels of complexity, and specifies the

number of questions in each content area by grade. The framework also outlines what mathematics
knowledge and skills students should have to reach Basic, Proficient, and Advanced achievement. The
mathematics framework was updated in 2005 and again in 2009. Survey questionnaires, administered to
students, teachers, and school administrators who participate in a mathematics assessment, are used to
collect and report contextual information about students’ learning experience in and out of the classroom.

State Performance Plan Indicators
Definition
The State Performance Plan (SPP) functions as an accountability mechanism and the actual plan for systems
change.  It documents quantifiable indications of performance in the priority areas of a free, appropriate
public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE), disproportionality, and effective general
supervision. Measurable and rigorous targets exist for each SPP indicator with the intention of leading to
improved results for children and youth with disabilities.  Annual performance reporting is required through
the Annual Performance Report (APR) to address ISBE’s progress toward meeting its targets.  Stakeholder
involvement remains key to the development and implementation of the SPP. The Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA 2004) requires states to develop and submit a State Performance Plan (SPP) to the Office
of Special Education Programs (OSEP) at the U.S. Department of Education. The SPP is designed to evaluate
the State's efforts to implement the requirements and purposes of IDEA and describe how the State will
improve its implementation. The plan consists of several priority areas with specific indicators defined for each
area. Measurable and rigorous targets are defined for each indicator to show progress throughout the life of
the SPP. States are required to publicly report on SPP Indicators 1-14. A link to the Illinois State Performance
Plan, Part B can be found at https://www.isbe.net/Pages/General-Supervision.aspx.

Business Rules
•  The State Performance Plan sets state targets/standards for each metric under the indicators. The district

score is compared to the state standard and a “District Met State Target” is determined.

o

If the district value is greater than or equal to the target, then the district is determined to
have Met the target (reported as a “YES”)

o  Else they did not meet the target (reported as a ‘NO’)
o  There are metrics where a district has no values (i.e. Early Childhood metrics in a high school

district) in which case the district and District Met value are N/A

•  There are 14 State Performance Plan (SPP) Indicators for Districts with data reported at the district

level.  The Indicators fall into two categories:

o

Indicators that are based on metrics calculated for reports other than SPP

▪  These include the IEP Graduation Rate, Dropout Rate, and Discipline indicators.
▪  These indicators are based on data that lag one year.

o

Indicators that are calculated specifically for SPP and are based on the current year data.

•  The following are the business rules for each metric for the 14 SPP Indicators.

o

Indicator 1: Graduation

▪

Indicator 1 is a results indicator that measures the percent of youth with Individualized
Education Programs (IEPs) graduating from high school with a regular diploma.

▪  Data is available when the Report Card snapshot is taken. However, data for this indicator
are “lag” data, so the State must describe the results of its examination of the data for the
year before the reporting year (e.g., for the FFY 2022 SPP/APR, use data from 2021-2022).

▪  Measurement/Calculation - States must report a percentage using the number

of youth with IEPs (ages 14-21) who exited special education due to graduating with a

Page 57

regular high school diploma in the numerator and the number of all youth with IEPs who
left high school (ages 14-21) in the denominator (in a single year).

o

Indicator 2: Dropout

▪

Indicator 2 is a results indicator that measures the percent of youth with IEPs dropping out
of high school.

▪  Data is available on February 21, 2024 for SY 2023 (EDFacts submission date). However,

data for this indicator are “lag” data, so the State must describe the results of its
examination of the data for the year before the reporting year (e.g., for the FFY 2022
SPP/APR, use data from 2021-2022).

▪  Measurement/Calculation - States must report a percentage using the number

of youth with IEPs (ages 14-21) who exited special education due to dropping out in the
numerator and the number of all youth with IEPs who left high school (ages 14-21) in the
denominator (in a single year).

o

Indicator 3: Statewide Assessment

▪

Indicator 3 is a results indicator that measures the participation and performance of
children with IEPs on statewide assessments:

•  A. Participation rate for children with IEPs
•  B. Proficiency rate for children with IEPs against grade level academic achievement

standards

•  C. Proficiency rate for children with IEPs against alternative academic achievement

standards

•  D. Gap in proficiency rates for children with IEPs and all students against grade level

academic achievement standards

▪  Data is available in January of the next school year (EDFacts final submission date). On the

2024 Report Card, for Indicator 3 we will use the April 2024 EDFacts submissions.

o

Indicator 4: Suspension/Expulsion

▪

▪

Indicator 4A is a results indicator that measures the rates of suspension/expulsion (Percent
of districts that have a significant discrepancy in the rate of suspensions/expulsions greater
than 10 cumulative days in a school year for children with IEPs).
Indicator 4B is a compliance indicator that measures the rates of suspension and expulsion
(Percent of districts that have [a] a significant discrepancy, by race or ethnicity, in the rate
of suspensions and expulsions greater than 10 days in a school year for children with IEPs
and [b] policies, procedures or practices that contribute to the significant discrepancy and
do not comply with requirements relating to the development and implementation of IEPs,
the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and procedural safeguards.

▪  Data is available around October 1 of the next school year (I.e., 2022-2023 discipline

data is available October 1, 2023). Data for Indicator 4 are “lag data,” so use the data for the
year before the reporting year [e.g., for the FFY 2022 SPP/APR due February 1, 2024, use
data from the 2021-22 school year].

▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  4A. Percent = [(# of LEAs that meet the State-established n and/or cell size (if

applicable) that have a significant discrepancy, as defined by the State, in the rates
of suspensions and expulsions for more than 10 days during the school year of

Page 58

children with IEPs) divided by the (# of LEAs in the State that meet the State-
established n and/or cell size (if applicable))] times 100.

•  4B. Percent = [(# of LEAs that meet the State-established n and/or cell size (if

applicable) for one or more racial/ethnic groups that have:

o

o

(a) a significant discrepancy, as defined by the State, by race or ethnicity, in
the rates of suspensions and expulsions of more than 10 days during the
school year of children with IEPs; and
(b) policies, procedures or practices that contribute to the significant
discrepancy, as defined by the State, and do not comply with requirements
relating to the development and implementation of IEPs, the use of positive
behavioral interventions and supports, and procedural safeguards) divided
by the (# of LEAs in the State that meet the State-established n and/or cell
size (if applicable) for one or more racial/ethnic groups)] times 100.

•  The state-specific calculations are:

o  District Level:  Total # of students with IEPs with more than 10 cumulative

days of Qualifying Suspensions/Expulsions in the District * 100 divided by the
total number of students with IEPs in the District.

o  State Level:  Total # of students with IEPs with more than 10 cumulative days
of Qualifying Suspensions/Expulsions in the State * 100 divided by the total
number of students with IEPs in the State.

o  Calculations are computed for the district and state with precision to two

decimal points.

o  The calculations are performed for the race group at district if there are 5 or

more students in the group.

o  A statewide standard deviation is calculated for total population using the
formula:  Square root (percent expelled or suspended * (100- percent
expelled or suspended)/total enrollment).

•  For 4A, a district is considered to have a significant discrepancy if the district rate is
greater than the State rate plus 1 standard deviation for three consecutive years
AND there are at least 5 students with IEPs suspended or expelled more than 10
days in each of the 3 school years.

•  For 4B a district is considered to have a significant discrepancy if the district rate

within a particular race/ethnicity group is greater than the State rate plus 1 standard
deviation for three consecutive years AND there are at least 5 students with IEPs
within a particular race/ethnicity suspended or expelled more than 10 days in each
of the 3 school years.  The district is considered to have a significant discrepancy if
the above conditional is met by at least one racial group.

o

Indicator 5: Education Environment (5-year-old kindergartners through age 21)

▪

Indicator 5 is a results indicator that measures the percent of students with IEPs (5-year-old
kindergartners through age 21) served inside the general education classroom 80% or more
of the school day (5A), inside the general education classroom less than 40% of the day
(5B), or in separate schools/residential facilities/home/hospital placements (5C).

▪  Data is available on June 28, 2023 for SY2023 (EDFacts submission date).

Page 59

▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  5A. Percent = [(# of children with IEPs aged 5 who are enrolled in kindergarten and

aged 6 through 21 served inside the regular class 80% or more of the day) divided by
the (total # of students aged 5 who are enrolled in kindergarten and aged 6 through
21 with IEPs)] times 100.

•  5B. Percent = [(# of children with IEPs aged 5 who are enrolled in kindergarten and
aged 6 through 21 served inside the regular class less than 40% of the day) divided
by the (total # of students aged 5 who are enrolled in kindergarten and aged 6
through 21 with IEPs)] times 100.

•  5C. Percent = [(# of children with IEPs aged 5 who are enrolled in kindergarten and

aged 6 through 21 served in separate schools, residential facilities, or
homebound/hospital placements) divided by the (total # of students aged 5 who are
enrolled in kindergarten and aged 6 through 21 with IEPs)] times 100.

o

Indicator 6: Education Environment (ages 3-5 in Preschool)

▪

Indicator 6 is a results indicator that measures the percent of children with IEPs (ages 3-5 in
Preschool) attending a regular early childhood (EC) program and receiving the majority
of special education and related services in the regular EC program (6A), a separate special
education class/separate school/residential facility (6B), or in the home (6C).

▪  Data is available on June 28, 2023 for SY2023 (EDFacts submission date).
▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  6A. Percent = [(# of children ages 3, 4, and 5 with IEPs attending a regular early
childhood program and receiving the majority of special education and related
services in the regular early childhood program) divided by the (total # of children
ages 3, 4, and 5 with IEPs)] times 100.

•  6B. Percent = [(# of children ages 3, 4, and 5 with IEPs attending a separate special
education class, separate school or residential facility) divided by the (total # of
children ages 3, 4, and 5with IEPs)] times 100.

•  6C. Percent = [(# of children ages 3, 4, and 5 with IEPs receiving special education

and related services in the home) divided by the (total # of children ages 3, 4, and 5
with IEPs)] times 100.

o

Indicator 7: Preschool Outcomes

▪

Indicator 7 is a results indicator that measures the percent of preschool children aged 3
through 5 with IEPs who demonstrate improved positive social-emotional skills (7A),
acquisition and use of knowledge and skills (7B) and use of appropriate behaviors to meet
their needs (7C) from their initial entry evaluation.

▪  Data is available in October for the preceding school year.
▪  Measurement/Calculation

•

Indicator 7 evaluates students exiting the preschool program in three Outcomes:

o  A. Positive social-emotional skills (including social relationships);
o  B. Acquisition and use of knowledge and skills (including early

language/communication and early literacy); and
o  C. Use of appropriate behaviors to meet their needs.

Page 60

•  The progress rating rates each of the three outcomes in one of five progress

categories/levels of functioning. Progress categories for outcome A, B and C are:
o  a. Percent of preschool children who did not improve functioning = [(# of
preschool children who did not improve functioning) divided by (# of
preschool children with IEPs assessed)] times 100.

o  b. Percent of preschool children who improved functioning but not sufficient
to move nearer to functioning comparable to same-aged peers = [(# of
preschool children who improved functioning but not sufficient to move
nearer to functioning comparable to same-aged peers) divided by (# of
preschool children with IEPs assessed)] times 100.

o  c. Percent of preschool children who improved functioning to a level nearer
to same-aged peers but did not reach it = [(# of preschool children who
improved functioning to a level nearer to same-aged peers but did not reach
it) divided by (# of preschool children with IEPs assessed)] times 100.
o  d. Percent of preschool children who improved functioning to reach a level
comparable to same-aged peers = [(# of preschool children who improved
functioning to reach a level comparable to same-aged peers) divided by (# of
preschool children with IEPs assessed)] times 100.

o  e. Percent of preschool children who maintained functioning at a level

comparable to same aged peers = [(# of preschool children who maintained
functioning at a level comparable to same-aged peers) divided by (# of
preschool children with IEPs assessed)] times 100.

•  There are two summary statements/indicators for each of the three outcomes:

o  Summary Statement 1: Of those preschool children who entered the

preschool program below age expectations in each Outcome, the percent
who substantially increased their rate of growth by the time they turned 6
years of age or exited the program.

o  Measurement for Summary Statement 1: Percent = [(# of preschool children
reported in progress category (c) plus # of preschool children reported in
category (d)) divided by (# of preschool children reported in progress
category (a) plus # of preschool children reported in progress category (b)
plus # of preschool children reported in progress category (c) plus # of
preschool children reported in progress category (d))] times 100.
o  Summary Statement 2: The percent of preschool children who were

functioning within age expectations in each Outcome by the time they
turned 6 years of age or exited the program.

o  Measurement for Summary Statement 2: Percent = [(# of preschool children
reported in progress category (d) plus # of preschool children reported in
progress category (e)) divided by (the total # of preschool children reported
in progress categories (a) + (b) + (c) + (d) + (e))] times 100.

•  For each of the three outcomes:

o  A1 is calculated as: counts from C + D * 100 divided by counts from A + B + C

+ D.

Page 61

o  A2 is calculated as: counts from D + E * 100 divided by counts from A + B + C

o

Indicator 8: Parent Involvement

+ D + E.

▪

Indicator 8 is a results indicator that measures the percent of parents with a child receiving
special education services who report that schools facilitated parent involvement as a
means of improving services and results for children with disabilities.

▪  Data for this indicator is extracted October 15.  ISBE receives data by late July from the

external vendor regarding survey results/data analysis and receives a report on the survey’s
representativeness from the vendor in the fall.

▪  Prior to school year 2022-2023, data for this indicator was extracted February 1.
▪  Starting in school year 2022-2023 the address file will be extracted from the finalized

December 1 Child Count from the previous year (e.g. December 1, 2022 Finalized Child
Count is used to supply the address file in October 2023). ISBE receives data by late July
from the external vendor regarding survey results/data analysis and receives a report on the
survey’s representativeness from the vendor in the fall.

▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  The calculation for the resident district or state is:

o  Percent = [(# of respondent parents who report schools facilitated parent
involvement as a means of improving services and results for children with
disabilities) divided by the (total # of respondent parents of children with
disabilities)] times 100.
Indicator 9: Disproportionate Representation in Special Education

o

▪

Indicator 9 is a compliance indicator that measures the percent of districts with
disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related
services that is the result of inappropriate identification. Indicator 9 compares the
enrollment of all students to those students with IEPs by Race/Ethnicity at a school, district
and state level.

▪  Data is available around April 1 of the current school year. (i.e., 2019-2020 Identification

available April 1 of 2020 when Fall Enrollment and Pupil Counts are approved).  Data for this
indicator is extracted on or around April 15.

▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  Percent = [(# of districts, that meet the State established n and/or cell size (if
applicable) for one or more racial/ethnic groups, with disproportionate
representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related services
that is the result of inappropriate identification) divided by the (# of districts in the
State that meet the State-established n and/or cell size (if applicable) for one or
more racial/ethnic groups)] times 100.

▪  State definition of disproportionate representation

•  Disproportionate representation (or disproportionality) of racial/ethnic groups in

special education is currently defined as students in a particular racial/ethnic group
(i.e., Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander,
Two or More Races, or White) being at a considerably greater risk of being identified
as eligible for special education and related services than all other racial/ethnic

Page 62

groups enrolled either in the LEA or in the state (depending on the type of risk ratio
calculation applied, as discussed below). ISBE uses a risk ratio to determine state risk
for racial/ethnic disproportionality. To determine LEA risk for racial/ethnic
disproportionality, ISBE uses a weighted risk ratio for LEAs in which there are at least
10 students in the racial/ethnic group and at least 10 students in the comparison
group (all students in the racial/ethnic group enrolled in the LEA), and an alternate
risk ratio for LEAs in which there are at least 10 students in the racial/ethnic group
but fewer than 10 students in the comparison group enrolled in the LEA. The State
utilized data from annual Fall Enrollment Counts from the Student Information
System, or SIS, (for all students, ages 6-21 served under IDEA) and December Child
Count (for students with IEPs, ages 6-21).
ISBE examines data in the given school year to determine the number of LEAs that
had at least 10 students with IEPs ages 6 – 21 (and 5-year-old children enrolled in
kindergarten) for the past three school years to determine how many LEAs met the
minimum “n” size for further analysis. ISBE calculates a weighted or alternate risk
ratio for every LEA in the state regarding overall special education eligibility. Such
risk ratios are calculated for each racial/ethnic group enrolled in a LEA. ISBE’s criteria
for determining over-representation based on race/ethnicity is a calculated
weighted or alternate risk ratio of 3.0 or higher for three consecutive years for a
particular racial/ ethnic group in which there are at least ten students in the special
education population.

o

Indicator 10: Disproportionate Representation in Specific Disability Categories

▪

Indicator 10 is a compliance indicator that measures the percent of districts with
disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in specific disability categories
that is the result of inappropriate identification. Indicator 10 compares the enrollment of all
students to those students with IEPs by Race/Ethnicity at a school, district and state level.

▪  Data is available around April 1 of the current school year. (i.e., 2022-2023 Identification

available April 15 of 2023 when Fall Enrollment and Pupil Counts are approved).

▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  Percent = [(# of districts, that meet the State established n and/or cell size (if
applicable) for one or more racial/ethnic groups, with disproportionate
representation of racial and ethnic groups in specific disability categories that is the
result of inappropriate identification) divided by the (# of districts in the State that
meet a State-established n and/or cell size (if applicable) for one or more
racial/ethnic groups)] times 100.
▪  State definition of disproportionate representation

•  Disproportionate representation (or disproportionality) of racial/ethnic groups in

special education disability categories is currently defined as students in a particular
racial/ethnic group (i.e., Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American, Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Two or More Races, or White) being at a
considerably greater risk of being identified as eligible for special education and
related services in a specific disability category (Speech/Language, Specific Learning
Disability, Emotional Disturbance, Intellectual Disability, Autism, and Other Health

Impairment) than all other racial/ethnic groups enrolled either in the LEA or in the
state (depending on the type of risk ratio calculation applied, as discussed below).
ISBE uses a risk ratio to determine state risk for racial/ethnic disproportionality. To
determine LEA risk for racial/ethnic disproportionality, ISBE uses a weighted risk
ratio for LEAs in which there are at least 10 students in the racial/ethnic group and
at least 10 students in the comparison group (all students in the racial/ethnic group
enrolled in the LEA), and an alternate risk ratio for LEAs in which there are at least
10 students in the racial/ethnic group but fewer than 10 students in the comparison
group enrolled in the LEA. The State utilized data from annual Fall Enrollment Counts
from the Student Information System, or SIS, (for all students, ages 6-21 served
under IDEA) and December Child Count (for students with IEPs, ages 6-21).
ISBE examines data for the given school year to determine the number of LEAs that
had at least 10 students ages 6 – 21 for the past three school years in one of the six
disability categories listed above to determine how many LEAs met the minimum
“n” size for further analysis. ISBE calculates a weighted or alternate risk ratio for
every LEA in the state regarding special education eligibility in the categories listed
above. Such risk ratios are calculated for each racial/ethnic group enrolled in a LEA.
ISBE’s criteria for determining over-representation based on race/ethnicity is a
calculated weighted or alternate risk ratio of 3.0 or higher for three consecutive
years for a particular racial/ethnic group in which there are at least ten students in
the special education disability category in question.

Indicator 11: Evaluation Timelines

▪

Indicator 11 is a compliance indicator that measures the percent of children who were
evaluated within 60 school days of receiving parental consent for initial evaluation.

▪  Data is extracted on or around July 15. Findings of noncompliance are issued September 1

annually.

▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  a. # of children for whom parental consent to evaluate was received.
•  b. # of children whose evaluations were completed within 60 days (or State-

established timeline).

•  Percent = [(b) divided by (a)] times 100.

o

Indicator 12: IDEA Part C to Part B Transition

▪

▪

Indicator 12 is a compliance indicator that measures the percent of children referred by Part
C prior to age 3, who are found eligible for Part B, and who have an IEP developed and
implemented by their third birthdays.
Indicator 12 analyzes the children referred by early intervention prior to age three who
were found eligible for special education services and have an IEP developed and
implemented by their third birthday.

▪  Data is extracted on or around July 15. Findings of noncompliance are issued September 1

annually.

▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  a. # of children who have been served in Part C and referred to Part B for Part B

eligibility determination.

Page 64

•  b. # of those referred determined to be NOT eligible and whose eligibility was

determined prior to their third birthdays.

•  c. # of those found eligible who have an IEP developed and implemented by their

third birthdays.

•  d. # of children for whom parent refusal to provide consent caused delays in

evaluation or initial services or to whom exceptions under 34 CFR §300.301(d)
applied.

•  e. # of children determined to be eligible for early intervention services under Part C

•

less than 90 days before their third birthdays.
f. # of children whose parents chose to continue early intervention services beyond
the child’s third birthday through a state’s policy under 34 CFR §303.211 or a similar
State option.

▪  Percent = [(c) divided by (a - b - d - e - f)] times 100.

o

Indicator 13: Secondary Transition

▪

Indicator 13 is a compliance indicator that measures the percent of youth with IEPs aged 16
and above with an IEP that includes appropriate measurable postsecondary goals that are
annually updated and based upon age-appropriate transition assessments, transition
services, including courses of study, that will reasonably enable the student to meet those
postsecondary goals, and annual IEP goals related to the student’s transition service needs.

▪  Additionally, Illinois state regulations require districts to complete a transition plan during

the year the student turns 14½ years of age and annually update the plan.

▪  Data is extracted July 15. Findings of noncompliance are issued September 1 annually.
▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  Percent = [(# of youth with IEPs aged 16 and above with an IEP that includes

appropriate measurable postsecondary goals that are annually updated and based
upon an age-appropriate transition assessment, transition services, including
courses of study, that will reasonably enable the student to meet those
postsecondary goals, and annual IEP goals related to the student’s
transition services needs. There also must be evidence that the student was invited
to the IEP Team meeting where transition services are to be discussed and evidence
that, if appropriate, a representative of any participating agency that is likely to be
responsible for providing or paying for transition services, including, if appropriate,
pre-employment transition services, was invited to the IEP Team meeting with the
prior consent of the parent or student who has reached the age of majority) divided
by the (# of youth with an IEP age 16 and above)] times 100.

o

Indicator 14: Post-School Outcomes

▪

Indicator 14 is a results indicator that measures the percent of youth who are no longer in
secondary school, had IEPs in effect at the time they left school, and were enrolled in higher
education within one year of leaving high school (14A), enrolled in higher education or
competitively employed within one year of leaving high school (14B), or enrolled in higher
education or in some other postsecondary education or training program; or competitively
employed or in some other employment within one year of leaving high school (14C). A
survey population is selected using the logic described below and the districts are then

Page 65

required to try to contact the former students and survey them. LEAs must document at
least three attempts to contact youth regarding the survey, and complete survey data must
be submitted to pass edit checks.

▪  Data for this indicator survey sample is extracted on April 1. After the survey window closes,
the Special Education department will request final survey results for SPP Indicator 14,
which occurs on or around October 15.

▪  Measurement/Calculation

•  14A. Percent enrolled in higher education = [(# of youth who are no longer in

secondary school, had IEPs in effect at the time they left school and were enrolled in
higher education within one year of leaving high school) divided by the (# of
respondent youth who are no longer in secondary school and had IEPs in effect at
the time they left school)] times 100.

•  14B. Percent enrolled in higher education or competitively employed within one

year of leaving high school = [(# of youth who are no longer in secondary school, had
IEPs in effect at the time they left school and were enrolled in higher education or
competitively employed within one year of leaving high school) divided by the (# of
respondent youth who are no longer in secondary school and had IEPs in effect at
the time they left school)] times 100.

•  14C. Percent enrolled in higher education, or in some other postsecondary
education or training program; or competitively employed or in some other
employment = [(# of youth who are no longer in secondary school, had IEPs in effect
at the time they left school and were enrolled in higher education, or in some other
postsecondary education or training program; or competitively employed or in some
other employment) divided by the (# of respondent youth who are no longer in
secondary school and had IEPs in effect at the time they left school)] times 100.

Advanced Placement (AP) Exam Passing Requirements
Definition
This metric will address students taking AP exams offered by the College Board. The College Board shares this
data with ISBE. There are four metrics for each school addressing AP Exams:
•  Students Taking One or More AP Exams
•  Students Eligible to Earn College Credit for One or More AP Exams
•  Total AP Exams Taken
•  Total AP Exams Eligible to Earn College Credit

The metric is the count of either students or exams. The counts are on the grade level.

Advanced Placement Coursework Enrollment (or Participation) is the number of students in grades 9 to 12
who participated in AP courses offered by the College Board.

Advanced Placement Exam Passing is the number of AP exams taken and the number of exams passed at any
point (score of 3 or higher) during high school, as well as the number of students who took at least one AP
exam and the number of students who passed at least one AP exam.

Business Rules
•  There are four metrics for each school addressing Advanced Placement Exams:
o  Students Taking One or More Advanced Placement (AP) Exams
o  Students Earning College Credit for One or More Advanced Placement (AP) Exams (meaning they

scored a 3 or higher)

o  Total Advanced Placement (AP) Exams Taken
o  Total Advanced Placement (AP) Exams Resulting in College Credit

•  “Advanced Placement” metrics are the count of either students or exams at the grade level.
•  “Advanced Placement” data is provided by the College Board to ISBE in a file.
•  The College Board shares this data with ISBE via a flat file.
•  The file is loaded into a staging table and the ISBE school RCDTS code is added to each record using the AI

Code provided by the College Board cross referenced to the RCDTS code.

•  The Assessment Departments maintains the cross-reference table.
•  Student records that are provided in the College Board data file are not matched to the Student

Information System (SIS).

•  The School indicated in the College Board data file is identified by the College Board.
•  A summary table at the School/District level is created from the College Board data file.

o  The counts are aggregated at the grade level
▪  Grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 are reported
▪  All other tests are excluded

•  The exam counts are an accumulation of the student's career and are listed under the last grade for which

the student tested.

o  For example, if a student took 1 test in 10th grade, 2 tests in 11th grade and 2 tests in 12th grade

then the school would show 5 tests in 12th grade for that student.

Page 101

•  A score of 3.0 or more will earn college credit at Illinois public colleges or universities.
•  “Students Taking One or More AP Exams”

o  This is the distinct count by grade of students taking an AP exam
o  The student must take an exam during the school year being reported
o  The grade is derived from the AP file

•  “Students Eligible to Earn College Credit for One or More AP Exams”

o  This is the distinct count of students that scored 3 or above on the AP test

•  “Total AP Exams Taken”

o  This is the count of all student-exams taken for each student’s career

▪  Example: ‘Student A’ takes the exams for Calculus BC in the prior year and US History in

the current reporting year and ‘Student B’ takes the exam for Chemistry in
the current reporting year.  In total there are 3 student-exams taken.

•  “Total AP Exams Eligible to Earn College Credit”

o  This is the count of all the exams where the student scored a 3 or higher on the exam

Postsecondary Enrollment
Definition
Postsecondary Enrollment represents the students who graduated with a regular high school diploma from a
public high school in Illinois two years prior to the current school year and enrolled in a U.S. college within 12
or 16 months. The datasets used are the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) for higher education
enrollment and ISBE’s Student Information System (SIS) for high school graduation.

Guidance Citation
State Statute/Guidance: Illinois School Code 105 ILCS 5/10-17a
Federal Statute/Guidance: EdFacts FS160 — High School Graduates Postsecondary Enrollment

Business Rules
•  The graduated students used in these post-secondary metrics consist of those who graduated two school

years prior to the Report Card reporting school year.

o

i.e. The 2023-24 Report Card uses student graduate data from the 2021-22 school year.
•  All students graduating during the school year regardless of which month they graduated are considered
enrolled within 12 months if the enrollment month is on or before September 30th of the following year.

o

(e.g. A student who graduated in school year 2015-16 would be considered enrolled within 12
months if the first post-secondary enrollment is during or before 9/30/2017.)

•  All students graduating during the school year regardless of when are considered enrolled within 16

months if the enrollment month is on or before January 31st, 2 years following graduation.

o

(e.g. A student who graduated in school year 2015-16 would be considered enrolled within 16
months if the first post-secondary enrollment is during or before 1/31/2018.)

•  The post-secondary institution level is indicated in NSC datafile as a ’2’ for Community College, ’4’ for

University, and an ’L’ for Trade/Vocational School.

•  The post-secondary institution type is indicated in the NSC datafile as a ’Public’ for a public institution

and ’Private’ for a private institution.

•  The school comes from the request file that was sent to NSC. It is the school from which the student

exited.

•  The postsecondary enrollment file contains data for graduates and non-graduates.

o  Report Card calculations only include students that graduated.

•  Edits Made to the NSC Datafile

o  The following are the general edits:

▪  NSC provides an enrollment status. Status codes with the following codes are marked as

incomplete enrollments and are excluded from the calculation:

•  A – Leave of Absence
•  W – Withdrawn
•  D – Deceased

▪  Enrollments for the same student at the same college beginning in the same month and

year are marked as a duplicate and the one with the latest end date is counted.

▪  Any enrollment where the end date is earlier than the begin date is marked as an error

and are excluded.

▪  Enrollments lasting less than 30 calendar days are excluded.
▪  Enrollments beginning prior to the graduation date are considered dual enrollment and

are excluded as a post-secondary enrollment.

Page 104

▪  The first enrollment beginning after the graduation date is identified as the first post-

secondary enrollment and is evaluated for placement and timeframe (12 or 16 month).

Formula (calculations)

Community College Remediation
•  “Community College Remediation” rates are calculated for the following four areas:

o  Overall (Reading, Math, or Communications)
o  Reading
o  Mathematics
o  Communications

•
•

ICCB collects course level data which indicates if a course is remedial.
ICCB delivers a file to ISBE that includes all ICCB students including:

o  Students not taking remedial course work.
o  Students taking remedial course work.
o  Students still in high school taking dual credit courses.

•  Only high school graduates are included in the calculation.
•

ISBE collects student-level course data and compares that to the remedial course data shared by ICCB to
determine whether a student received credit in remedial Math, remedial Reading or remedial
Communications courses.
If the student has remedial credit in either Math, Reading, or Communication then the student is counted
in the “Overall” group.

•

•  The ICCB student is matched to the SIS graduating class immediately preceding the ICCB school year being

reported.

o  For the [current year] report card the ICCB [current year – 1] year-end data will be provided and

matched against the ISBE [current year – 2] graduating class using the common demographic data
administrator ID.

•  The denominator for the formula is the distinct number of students from the school/district/state that

attended an ICCB institution

•  The overall community college remediation rate is determined by dividing the distinct count of students

with at least 0.5 credit in remedial math, remedial reading, or remedial communications by the number of
students attending an ICCB institution and multiplying the resulting quotient by 100.

•  The calculation is repeated for each subject individually e.g.:

o

((distinct count of students with at least 0.5 credit in remedial math) ÷ (the number of students
attending an ICCB institution)) x 100.

Graduation Rate
Definition
Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate is the rate of graduates compared to the total number of students in their
four-year, five-year, and six-year cohort for schools, districts, and states.

Adjusted Cohort Graduation Student Count is defined as the number of graduates in four-year, five-year, and
six-year cohort for schools, districts, and states.

Graduation Rate is calculated based on Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) High School Graduation Rate
guidance found here. Students are reported at the home school. The cohort is based on the number of
students who enter grade 9 for the first time, adjusted by adding into the cohort any student who transfers in
later during grade 9 or during the next three years and subtracting any student from the cohort who transfers
out, emigrates to another country, transfers to a prison or juvenile facility, or dies during that same period.

Adjusted-Cohort Graduation Rate: https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html

Business Rules
•  The adjusted cohort graduation rate is determined by dividing the number of “graduates” that belong to a
specified “cohort” by the total number of graduates and “non-graduates” in that cohort and multiplying
the resulting quotient by 100.

•  The cohort year is calculated from the reporting school year as follows:

o  Four-year cohort: School year – 3 = School year for the 9th grade cohort (e.g. For SY 2024, the four-

year cohort consists of students whose first year in 9th grade was SY2020-21.)

o  Five-year cohort: School year – 4 = School year for the 9th grade cohort (e.g. For SY 2024, the five-

year cohort consists of students whose first year in 9th grade was SY2019-20.)

o  Six-year cohort: School year – 5 = School year for the 9th grade cohort (e.g. For SY 2024, the six-

year cohort consists of students whose first year in 9th grade was SY2018-19.)

o  They transferred outside the entity (school/district/state)
o  They transferred to being home-schooled
o  They transferred to private school
o  They have an exit code for death

Page 110

o  Note: The table below indicates what exit codes are included (“I”) in the graduation cohort and

which are excluded (“E”).

•  A student is considered a graduate if the exit code for their last enrollment is “06 – Graduated”
•  A student is considered a non-graduate if the exit code for their last enrollment is NOT “06 – Graduated”.
•  Responsible School is determined based on the student’s last enrollment.
•  Students are not counted at more than one school/district.
•  The above rules are applied for the 4-year, 5-year, and 6-year cohort on a school, district, and state basis.
•  Any student who had an Individual Education Program (IEP) or a 504 plan and therefore included in the
children with disabilities (CWD) group, was an EL, was homeless, or was a Youth in Care any time during
their high school career will be counted in the aforementioned groups.

•  A student status as ever being an IEP, CWD, EL, Homeless, or YIC is updated in the “Student Fact Table” or

the “ACGR table”.

•  A student’s race, gender, low-income status, military status, migrant status and private school status

comes from the record in the most recent school year available.

Early Learning (KIDS)
Definition
The Kindergarten Individual Development Survey (KIDS) is an observational assessment tool designed to help
teachers, administrators, families and policymakers better understand the development of children in
kindergarten. ISBE requires kindergarten teachers to collect observations beginning on the first 40 days of
student attendance on a minimum of 14 required measures, which are from three key developmental
areas.  This subset of 14 measures provides a developmental indicator for a group of students (class, school,
district, state) in kindergarten.

Guidance Citation
State Statute/Guidance: 105 ILCS 5/10-17a (2)(D)
Federal Statute/Guidance: N/A

Business Rules
•  Districts that should be included in the count should have students enrolled in categories 2, 4, and 8.
•  Kindergarten teachers are required to collect observations in the first 40 days of student enrollment, on a

minimum of 14 required measures in three key developmental areas.

o  Note that eligible student enrollment is based on valid SIS enrollment.

•  The three key developmental areas are:

o  Social and Emotional Development
o  Language and Literacy Development
o  Cognition: Math

•  Kindergartners who are rated on all 14 required measures and who are rated ready in all three

developmental areas are considered Kindergarten Ready.

•  Participation Numerator

o  Students from the denominator that have a valid score
o  The score file entity must match the serving school entity in the denominator

•  Participation Denominator

o  All valid enrollments for kindergarten students are determined by a count of distinct students’

longest student enrollments within the period from the beginning of the school year up until Nov. 1
that is included in the Fall snapshot.

▪  Longest Enrollment must be at least 30 days.
▪

If there are multiple enrollments of the same length, and both are at least 30 days, use the
most recent enrollment.

▪  NOTE: All students who have a valid score (includes a score from D1 (ATL-REG/SED

measure) and D2(LLD, Alt LLD measures) and D3 (MATH: COG measures)) and ANY matching
valid enrollment captured in the fall snapshot (this snapshot includes all SIS enrollments
entered up until winter when the snapshot is taken) should be included in the participation
denominator no matter the length of the enrollment

Climate Survey
Definition
Climate Survey is a survey taken by all Grade PK-12 teachers and all Grade 4-12 students as required by
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) State Plan. The State Board of Education shall administer a
Climate Survey, identified by and paid for by the State Board of Education, to provide feedback from, at
a minimum, students in Grades 4 through 12 and teachers on the instructional environment within a
school, according to 105 ILCS 5/2-3.153 (ilga.gov). The information collected through the survey is
rigorously reviewed and analyzed to generate a report for each school. There are three Climate Surveys
approved for use by ISBE -- 5Essentials, Cognia, and Comprehensive School Climate Inventory.

Climate Survey Response Schools is the percentage of schools with over a 50 percent response rate on
the school climate Survey.

Climate Survey Response Students is the total number of individual students responding to the School
Climate Survey, divided by the total number of eligible students.  Students are eligible to participate if
they are enrolled in a school and are cognitively able to participate in the survey.

For the 2022 Report Card, and moving forward, Climate Survey Response Teachers represents the total
number of teachers responding to the Climate Survey, divided by the total number of eligible teachers.

Teachers rostered to take the teacher survey include Self-contained and subject-specific classroom
teachers; Cooperating classroom teachers; Special education teachers working in a single classroom or
across classrooms; and Counselors, librarians, and other staff members who teach students.

Teachers eligible to participate in the survey but not rostered include Instructional coaches and subject
matter specialists; and Teacher aides and paraprofessionals.

5Essentials
The 5Essentials Survey results offer a comprehensive analysis of a school’s organizational culture, generating
data that allows schools to develop improvement plans and target resources to areas known to be related to
increases in student learning. There are two components of the 5Essential Survey, the results of the survey
and the response rate for the survey. The survey results are for schools only and record the result level for
each of the 5Essential Categories. On the district level, the percent of schools with a response rate over
50 percent is calculated and compared to the state rate. On the school level, the response rate of the teachers
and students are calculated and compared to the state rate.

Cognia (formerly AdvancED )
The Cognia (formerly AdvancED) Stakeholder Surveys are designed for an educational institution to gather
data on its stakeholders’ perceptions, opinions, and overall knowledge of various facets of the institution.
Administering the suite of surveys (student, staff, and parent) fulfills one accreditation requirement for all
types of educational institutions: public, school system, private, international, faith-based, early learning
centers, corporations, or distance learning.

Page 119

Comprehensive School Climate Inventory (CSCI)
The Comprehensive School Climate Inventory (CSCI) is one of the nation’s most scientifically sound and helpful
surveys that provide immediate feedback on how students, parents, and school personnel perceive your
school's particular climate for learning. Vetted by the National School Climate Council, three independent
reviews of school climate measures, a core group of practice and policy leaders, the CSCI is one of the top
school climate surveys in the field. This social, emotional, and civic as well as intellectual information provides
a foundation for the five-stage school climate improvement process. Click here to read Frequently Asked
Questions for Researchers.

Illinois Youth Survey
Definition
The Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) has funded the administration of the Illinois Youth Survey
(IYS) biennially since 1990. The IYS is a self-report survey administered in school settings and is designed to
gather information about a variety of health and social indicators including substance use patterns and
attitudes of Illinois youth.

The administration of the IYS has two major goals:
•  To supply local data to schools and school districts throughout Illinois. During state-funded survey years
(e.g., 2018, 2020, etc.), the survey is available to all eligible public and private schools in the state at no
cost. Each participating school is eligible to receive a report specific to their own students' responses.
These local reports provide critical information to school administrators, prevention professionals, and
community members as they work to address substance abuse issues in their communities.

•  To provide a scientific estimate of health and social indicators for the state of Illinois. The scientific

estimate is based on drawing a random sample to represent the state population of 8th, 10th, and 12th
graders in Illinois public schools.

Annual Financial Report
Definition
The Annual Financial Report (AFR) for a district is the final financial statement for a Local Education Agency's
(LEA) fiscal year after it has been audited by a qualified auditor. Each district is required to have an annual
audit completed by a qualified and licensed auditing firm. The AFR is completed by the auditor and is
submitted to Illinois State Board of Education.

Expenditure by Function consists of expenditures for instruction, general administration, support services, and
other expenditures.

Local Property Taxes means the receipt of taxes that apply to the prior year’s levies, as well as those available
from the current levy.  Also included are payments in lieu of taxes as monies from the Corporate Personal
Property Replacement Tax.

Evidence-Based Funding (EBF) for Invest in Kids Act, or Public Act 100-0465, became law on August 31, 2017.
Five previous grant programs are combined into a single grant program and distributed as EBF. Those grant
programs are General State Aid, Special Education – Personnel, Special Education – Funding for Children
Requiring Special Education Services, Special Education – Summer School, and English Learner
Education.  Districts receive the same amounts from these grant programs as they did in the year prior to the
new law. That hold harmless provision is known as the Base Funding Minimum. In addition, districts receive
funding based on their assignment to one of four tiers, which represent a ranking of their capacity to meet
expectations.

Expenditure by Fund is the total expenditure from each of the eight funds: educational, operations and
maintenance, transportation, debt service, tort, municipal retirement/Social Security, fire prevention and
safety, and capital projects.

Equalized Assessed Valuation per Pupil includes all computed property values upon which a district’s local tax
rate is calculated.

Total School Tax Rate Per $100 is an indication of district effort. It is the district’s total tax rate for education
(per $100) as shown on local property tax bills.

Instructional Expenditure per Pupil includes the direct costs of teaching pupils or the interaction between
teachers and pupils.

Operating Expenditure per Pupil includes the gross operating cost of a school district, excluding summer
school, adult education, bond principal retired, and capital expenditures.

Evidence-Based Funding (EBF)
Definition
Evidence-Based Funding (EBF) for Student Success Act, or Letter Bill 1..550 (ilga.gov), became law on August
31, 2017. Five previous grant programs were combined into a single grant program and distributed as EBF.
Those grant programs are General State Aid, Special Education – Personnel, Special Education – Funding for
Children Requiring Special Education Services, Special Education – Summer School, and English Learner
Education. Districts receive the same amounts from these grant programs as they did in FY 2017, the year
prior to implementation of EBF. That hold harmless provision is known as the Base Funding Minimum. In
addition, when there are sufficient appropriations, districts receive funding based on their assignment to one
of four tiers.  The tiers represent a ranking of district resources compared to individual district education costs.

Detailed information about these EBF metrics to be included on the Report Card are
published here: https://www.isbe.net/Documents/EBF_Presentation_Detailed.pdf
•  EBF Adequacy Target

o  EBF Adequacy Target is the minimum cost to educate students within the district based on the cost

factors outlined in the Evidence-Based Funding (EBF) formula. It is the denominator of each
district’s Percentage of Adequacy calculation. Please refer to ISBE’s resource materials for the
methodology and the list of cost factors used to determine a district's Adequacy Target. Each
district’s Adequacy Target is calculated by ISBE and updated annually.

•  EBF District Tier Assignment

o  EBF District Tier Assignment is the tier assigned to each district pursuant to EBF. There are four

tiers numbered 1 through 4. The Tier 1 threshold is set annually. Tier 2 districts have a Percentage
of Adequacy greater than or equal to the Tier 1 target ratio and less than 90 percent. Tier 3 districts
have a Percentage of Adequacy greater than or equal to 90 percent and less than 100 percent. Tier
4 districts have a Percentage of Adequacy greater than or equal to 100 percent.

•  EBF Local Capacity Target

o  EBF Local Capacity Target is an amount of funding each district is assumed to contribute toward its
Adequacy Target for purposes of EBF calculations. Local Capacity Target is the largest of the three
elements of Final Resources and is based in part on Equalized Assessed Valuation amounts.

•  EBF Percentage of Adequacy

o  EBF Percentage of Adequacy is a ratio equal to a district’s Final Resources divided by its Adequacy

Target in EBF. Each district’s Percentage of Adequacy determines its tier assignment in a given year
when increased funding is provided.

•  EBF Real Receipts

o  EBF Real Receipts is an amount that is used to adjust the Local Capacity Target calculation when the
product of the Real Receipts calculation exceeds the Local Capacity Target. Real Receipts are equal
to Adjusted Real Equalized Assessed Value multiplied by Adjusted Operating Tax Rate.

•  EBF Real Receipts / Adequacy Target

o  EBF Real Receipts / Adequacy Target – Comparing Real Receipts to the Adequacy Target will
illustrate a district’s estimated ability to generate local revenue compared to the expected
contribution to providing an adequate education per EBF cost factors.

•  Each school year, Report Card will use EBF values from the EBF calculations from the fiscal

year corresponding to the school year of the data on the report. For example, the Report Card published in
fall 2024 showing school year 2024 data will use EBF values from the fiscal year 2024 calculations.
•  Each fiscal year after completion of EBF calculations (estimated to be by end of July), a new spreadsheet

will be published. Until a formal process has been developed to integrate the data into the data
warehouse, the dataset will be manually imported into ISBE’s data warehouse for integration into
the Report Card data mart for publication on the corresponding Report Card.

Average Class Size
Definition
Class size refers to the number of students in a classroom, specifically either (1) the number of students being
taught by individual teachers in a classroom or (2) the average number of students being taught by teachers in
a school, district, or education system.

Guidance Citation
State Statute/Guidance: Illinois School Code 105 ILCS 5/10-17a
Federal Statute/Guidance: N/A

Business Rules
•  Average Class Size is calculated by taking the average of all the section-level enrollments at a

school/district/state for core courses.

•  Enrollment is counted on a class and section basis per school/district/state for the following courses:

o  Core classes with course code beginning in 01-04, 51-54, or 23.

•  The following courses are excluded:

o  Special Education classes

▪  A Special Education class is any class with more than 30% of the enrolled students having

IEPs

▪  Grade-level average class size excludes any class with more than 30% of enrolled students in

the respective grade level having IEPs

o  Biblical Literature (01059A000),
o

In high school, courses whose title include “workplace”, “cooperative” “aide”, “other”, or
“independent”,

o  Classes with only one or 0 students enrolled

▪  Grade-level average class size excludes classes with only one or 0 students in the respective

grade-level enrolled

o  High school classes with more than 50 students enrolled in grades 9 to 12, or
o  Elementary classes with more than 40 students enrolled in grades K to 8
o  Summer school students are excluded from this count, which are those who have an enrollment

date equal to or greater than 6/1

o  Student Course Assignments where the outcome is Erroneous.
o  Note: Student course assignments where the outcome is null will be included in the Average Class

Size calculation.

•  The grade level for non-grade specific courses is determined by the grade of the students enrolled in the

section.

•  Sum the section level enrollment counts at each school/district/state and divide the total by the number of

sections at each school/district/state to arrive at the average class size.

Site-Based Expenditure Reporting (SBER)
Definition
ESSA requires that SEAs report on their Report Card: “The per-pupil expenditures of Federal, State, and local
funds, including actual personnel expenditures and actual non-personnel expenditures of Federal, State, and
local funds, disaggregated by source of funds, for each local educational agency and each school in the State
for the preceding fiscal year.”
•  “Per-pupil expenditures for each School” is the sum of per-pupil site-level and centralized expenses funded

by federal and state/ local sources of funds.

•  “Per-pupil expenditures for each school, disaggregated by federal source of funds” is the sum of per-pupil

site-level and centralized expenses spent by each school using federal fund sources.

•  “Per-pupil expenditures for each School, disaggregated by state and local source of funds” is the sum of
per-pupil site-level and centralized expenses spent by each school using state and local fund sources
combined.

•  The site-level expenditures must include the following:

o  Personnel salaries
o  Benefits
o  Related costs exclusively assigned to a school
o  Any non-personnel costs specifically attributable to the school

•  “Per-pupil expenditures for each school, disaggregated by school expenses” is the sum of per-pupil site-

level expenses spent by each school using federal and state/ local sources of funds.

•  “Per-pupil school-level Expenditures for each School, disaggregated by federal source of funds” is the per-

pupil site-level expenses spent by each school using the federal source of funds.

•  “Per-pupil school-level Expenditures for each School, disaggregated by state and local source of funds” is

the per-pupil site-level expenses spent by each school using state and local sources of funds.

•  District centralized expenditures must include the following:

o  Central office administrative expenses
o  Transportation, Operation & Maintenance, Food Services, pupil support services, and other LEA-

defined cost categories.

o  The proportional share of a District's centralized expenditures represents an allocation of

centralized expenditures as a proxy for dollars spent for centralized services serving each school.

o  The district's centralized expenditures are apportioned across all sites using metrics such as

Enrollment FTE, Student Count Mileage, Square footage, etc.

•  "Per-pupil expenditures for each School, disaggregated by District centralized level" is the sum of the
school's share of per-pupil district centralized expenses spent using federal and state/local sources of
funds.

•  "Per-pupil District centralized Expenditures for each School, disaggregated by federal source of funds" is

the school's share of per-pupil district centralized expenses spent using federal sources of funds.

•  "Per-pupil LEA Centralized Expenditures for each School, disaggregated by state and local source of funds"
is the school's allocated share of per-pupil district centralized expenses funded by state and local sources
of funds.

•  “District Expenditures Excluded from Per-Pupil Averages” is the sum of all expenditures excluded from

Site-Based Expenditure Reporting. Excluded expenditures will not need to be disaggregated.

o  Excluded expenditures do not reflect expenses for pre-K through grade 12 students being served or

placed by the LEA (thereby excluding costs for adult education and community services, for
example).

Page 142

o  Excluded expenditures do not reflect largely ongoing, normal course resource allocations (excluding

non-education fund capital expenditures and debt service, for example).

o  A list of the most frequent exclusions appears in ISBE’s annual Site-Based Expenditures Reporting

Guidance on the SBER webpage.

o  Exclusions are categorized by fund, function, and object (according to the Illinois Administrative

Code Part 100 Rules for Accounting, Budgeting, and Financial Reporting, available here.

•  “Omitted Expenditures Omitted from Per-pupil averages” is the sum of all expenditures omitted from

District Total Current Expenditures

o  The intent behind these omissions is to avoid overstating total district expenditures (omitting Fund

70 Working Cash funds from reporting, for example).

o  A list of the omissions appears in ISBE’s annual Site-Based Expenditures Reporting Guidance on the

SBER webpage.

•  Site Type

o  Default Site:

▪  Site that has a unique RCDTS code. These site entries do not require a subgroup code (flag).
▪  Default sites are sites with a proportional student enrollment of 1 or more.
▪  Sites with zero proportional student enrollment do not display as default sites; however,

LEAs may manually add any sites not listed as long as the site is an open entity at any time
during the fiscal year in the Entity Profile System.

▪  Redaction rules:

•  Any SBER Enrollment less than 10 should be redacted from Report Card display

o  Separate LEA Outplacements:

▪  Applies to LEAs that elect to report the total proportional count of students educated

outside of the district at a single reporting site.  (LEAs may choose between this reporting
option or, instead, reporting this proportional student enrollment at their home sites.)

•

If an LEA’s proportional count of students placed outside the district is 10 or fewer,
the LEA must include this proportional count in the student’s home sites.

▪

Includes all placements served outside the district regardless of reason (e.g., special
education, career tech/vocational education, and often Regional Safe Schools and
Alternative Learning Opportunities Program) and associated expenditures.

▪  Two-digit flag to indicate this site type is “OP.”
▪  RCDTS Code is the reporting district code for this entry.
▪  This separate reporting site will appear as a site on the district Report Card. An asterisk is

applicable to separate outplaced site.

▪  This separate reporting site does not receive a school Report Card.

•  Deactivated Placements:

o  LEA(s) with students whose home schools have been deactivated are provided with a
mechanism to report their deactivated placements as a separate reporting site.
o  All deactivated enrollments served at different sites are grouped into one single

“deactivated placements” reporting site.

o  Any LEA in which all schools have been deactivated and all students are placed into
serving schools outside of the Home LEA will report under a single “deactivated
placement” reporting site.

o  Two-digit flag to indicate this site type is “DP.”
o  RCDTS Code is the reporting district code for this entry.
o  This reporting site is separate from Students Served outside the District (Separate

District Outplacements).

Page 143

o  This separate reporting site will appear as a site on the District Report Card. An asterisk

is applicable to sites with deactivated placements.

•  Site Detail Type

•  An LEA has the option to call out expenditures and enrollment associated with pre-K classrooms within

school sites serving other grade levels.

o  Both “PK” and “NP” subgroup codes (flags) are associated with school sites serving other

grade levels including pre-K classrooms.

▪  Designated pre-K and early childhood centers are separate reporting sites and will

not use these subgroup codes (flags).

o  “PK” flag indicates all students aged 3-5 enrolled at pre-K classrooms within an existing

elementary (or other grade level) school site.

o  “NP” flag indicates all students attending other grades excluding students enrolled within

pre-K classrooms served at the same elementary (or other grade level) school site.

o  RCDTS Code is the elementary (or other grade levels) school code for this entry. This code

will be the same for both the non-Pre-K and Pre-K entries, since the two sets of grade levels
are served at the same site.

o  The business rules section of this document illustrates the requirements for displaying

enrollment FTE and associated expenditures of the Pre-K classroom callouts.

•  School-Level Public Narrative (optional)

o  Provides every LEA to script optional narratives for individual schools, to help “tell their story.”
o  This optional LEA-developed school-level narrative is displayed on the school Report Card if

provided.

•  District-Level Public Narrative (optional)

o  Provides every LEA the opportunity to give further context and narrative to accompany the Site-

Based Expenditure data set for the LEA.

o  This optional LEA-developed district-level narrative is displayed on the district Report Card if

provided.

•  District Average Per-Pupil Expenditures

o  This metric is the average per-pupil expenditures at district level.

•  Total District Expenditures

o  This metric is the total dollars included in reporting (allocated to sites) plus total exclusions.

•  SBER Enrollment Rules

o  SBER enrollments include all PK-12 enrollment records that span 1-Oct or 1-Mar.
o  Unlike the RC and EBF, there is no notion of a primary enrollment for each student.  ALL enrollment

records contribute FTE (i.e. Percent of Day Attended).**

o  Each enrollment record is counted at its Home District (or Deactivated District when

applicable***).

o  When the Serving School is within the Home District, the record is counted at that Serving School.
o  When the Serving School is outside the Home District, the record is considered Outplaced.
o  Each Home District may choose whether to include ALL Outplaced FTE at the records' Home

Schools or in aggregate at the district-level.

o  For each District and School above, SBER sums the records' FTE for 1-Oct and does the same for 1-

Mar.

o  The 1-Oct and 1-Mar sums are then averaged to produce SBER Default Enrollment FTEs.
o  SBER requires expenditure reporting from the above Districts when total FTE > 0 and the District

entity is in EPS Category 2.

Page 144

o  Reporting districts are not required to use the SBER Defaults but are guided to follow rules like

those above.

o  Reporting districts may choose to omit SBER default schools or include additional District schools in

EPS Categories 4, E, or 8.****

o  ** Enrollment records are excluded when served at Detention Centers, State Funded schools, or

are Tuition In.

o  *** Deactivated enrollments are aggregated at the district-level and reported by the home District.
o  **** Additional District schools must have EPS Open and Close dates that overlap with the State

FY.

•  District Enrollment

o  This metric is the total of all the enrolled students within the LEA, according to their percent of day

attended (PDA) recorded in the Student Information System (SIS).

o  This metric is the sum of enrollments reported within all sites of the LEA, including any separate

reporting sites for students educated outside the district.

o  An enrollment of 1.0 indicates that the student is receiving a full day of services. Students receiving
services for only part of each day shall be counted as proportional students based on percentage of
day listed in SIS.

o  This sum should equal the total number of children (according to their proportionate

enrollment) aged 3 through 21 in grades prekindergarten through 12 served by the LEA or placed
outside the district by the LEA.

▪  Within SBER Guidance, “prekindergarten students” refers broadly to the proportional
student FTE count of students ages 3-5 for whom a district incurs costs for educational
services provided, inclusive of prekindergarten (pre-K) and early childhood
education. Students enrolled in birth to three programs are excluded from Site-Based
Expenditure Reporting.

o  The average of the enrolled proportional student count (related to students from or served outside

the district) on October 1st and March 1st of the reporting year shall be used.

•  Site-level SBER Enrollment

o  This metric includes every student the school serves, except for students being served in the school

who originate from outside the LEA.

o  Students served outside the LEA should be included in reporting by the Home LEA.
o  The average of the enrolled proportional student count (related to students from or served outside

the district) on October 1st and March 1st of the reporting year shall be used.

o  Students receiving services for only part of each day shall be counted as proportional students

based on percentage of day (Percentage of Day Attended – PDA) listed in SIS.

o  All students whose PDA is reported as 1.0 within SIS, indicating that they attend school on a full-day

basis, are counted as 1.0 student enrollment FTE for site-based expenditure reporting.

Feeder Schools
Definition
A “Feeder School” is defined as a school from which a majority of students progress to a high-level educational
school. For example, middle schools are feeder schools for high schools. A school is considered a feeder school
if 50 percent or more of the students in the terminating grade attend a single school the following year. For
example, a middle school where 78 percent of the eighth-grade students attend the same high school would
be a feeder school of that high school.

Guidance Citation
State Statute/Guidance: N/A
Federal Statute/Guidance: N/A

Business Rules
•  Students are included in the Feeder School calculation if:

o  The student has a valid enrollment record in the current school year and the previous school year.
o  The grade level for the student’s previous school year enrollment is at least one year behind the

student’s grade level in the current school year.

o  The grade level for the student’s previous school year enrollment must equal the maximum grade
level (based on serving school enrollment) served at the school for which the student was enrolled
in the previous school year.

▪  E.g. only 8th graders at a K-8 or 7-8 school, only 5th graders at a K-5 or 3-5 school, etc.

o  The grade level for the student’s current school year enrollment must equal the minimum grade

served at the school for which the student is enrolled in the current school year.

▪  E.g. only 9th graders at a 9-12 school

•  All students that meet the criteria are grouped by Serving School for the previous school year. This is the

“Feeder School Enrollment” for a school.

o  Only consider a grade of a school if that grade has at least 15 “Feeder School Enrollments” in the

previous school year.

o  Example:

▪  School A has 100 qualifying 8th graders in previous school year
▪  School B has 80 qualifying 8th graders in previous school year
▪  School C has 50 qualifying 8th graders in previous school year

•  All students in each group are then grouped by Serving School for the current school year. This is the

“Receiving School Enrollment by Feeder School”.

o  Example:

▪  School A in previous school year had 60 qualifying 9th graders attending High School X in

current school year

▪  School B in previous school year had 30 qualifying 9th graders attending High School X in

current school year

▪  School C in previous school year had 26 qualifying 9th graders attending High School Y in

current school year
•  The Feeder School percentage is then calculated as:

o

(Receiving School Enrollment by Feeder School ÷ Feeder School Enrollment) × 100

•

If the Feeder School percentage >= 50% then the school indicated in the denominator (previous year
school) is flagged as a “feeder school” for the current year school.

o  Example:

Page 151

▪  School A had 60 of 100 8th grade students in previous school year enroll in High School X in
current school year.  60/100*100 = 60%.  School A is a feeder school for High School X.
▪  School B had 30 of 80 8th grade students in previous school year enroll in High School X in
current school year.  30/80*100 = 37.5%.  School B is NOT a feeder school for High School
X.

▪  School C had 26 of 50 8th grade students in previous school year enroll in High School Y in
current school year.  26/50*100 = 52%.  School C is a feeder school for High School Y.

•  NOTE: Not every school will be considered a feeder school.

o  For example

▪  School D has 200 8th graders in the previous year
▪  80 of those enroll in High School X in the current school year
▪  70 of those enroll in High School Y in the current school year
▪  50 of those enroll in High School Z in the current school year
▪  80/200*100 = 40%.  School D is NOT a feeder school for High School X
▪  70/200*100 = 35%.  School D is NOT a feeder school for High School Y
▪  50/200*100 = 25%.  School D is NOT a feeder school for High School Z

•  SIS Student records are matched longitudinally such that information from the current school year is linked

in a record with information from the students’ previous school year.
Information included in the record are as follows:

•

o  A unique identifier
o  Student grade in current year
o  Student grade in previous year
o  Student’s serving school in current year
o  Student’s serving school in previous year

•  Only student records for the students’ fall enrollment are included.

o  Only students who are enrolled at a single school for at least 50% of the day (enrollment FTE of 0.5

or greater) should be a part of the calculation

•  Only student records where the student’s grade in the previous year is equal to the maximum grade

served at the school are included in the calculation.

o  E.g. only 8th graders at a K-8 or 7-8 school, only 5th graders at a K-5 or 3-5 school, etc.)
•  Only student records where the student’s grade in the previous year is at least one grade behind the

student’s grade in the current year i.e. no retained students.

•  Records that only have data for either the current year or the previous year are not included.
•  Records are grouped by serving school for the previous year. The number of records in this group can be

considered the “Feeder Calculation Enrollment” for a school.

•  The records within each group are summarized by the current year serving school.
•  The sum of each record per current year serving school is calculated as a percent of the Feeder Calculation

Enrollment as such:

o

(Sum of Current School Year Records ÷ Feeder School Enrollment) × 100

•

If the Percent of Current School Year >= 50% then the school indicated in the denominator (previous year
school) is flagged as a “feeder” for the current year school.

Student Enrollment
Definition
Student Enrollment is the total student enrollment in the school and district as of October 1st of
the current school year. District level enrollment includes students attending a school in the district and
students placed in private schools by the district and funded by the district.

The Student Enrollment excludes:
•  Students given vouchers to attend private schools
•  Students placed by their parents in private schools whose tuition is paid for by their parents, but who

receive special education services from their home district

specifications.html

Business Rules
•  Student Enrollment is the distinct count of students and their associated demographic characteristics

aggregated at the school, district, and state level.

•  Each student is mapped to a single enrollment.
•  The data will be compiled from the ISBE approved Fall Enrollment snapshot.

o  The 2024 Fall Enrollment snapshot is an exact copy of the SIS student demographic and enrollment

tables.

Include Grades Pre-Kindergarten through 12th Grade.  Exclude “Evaluation” and “Birth to Three.”

•
•  The enrollment counts will be based on the serving school.
•  Excludes students marked as “Private School Student” in SIS.
•  The enrollment must be an active enrollment.
•  The student must be enrolled on October 1st of the school year.

o  The enrollment begin date must be on or before October 1st.
o  The enrollment end date must be on or after October 1st.
o  Because the snapshot is taken during the school year many of the enrollments do not have an end

date. These are all included.

•  Only students that have at least 50% percent day attended (PDA) should be included in the school, district,

or state level counts.

o

If the student has active multiple enrollments on October 1st, the student is included if the total
PDA > 0.50.

•  For students that have two active enrollments on October 1st where the PDA on

both enrollments are equal to 50% the enrollment meeting the school that is credited with the enrollment
will be:
o
If the home school is one of the schools OR ELSE,
o  the enrollment with the earlier enrollment date.
o  The warehouse applies this logic to all enrollments and flags the enrollment that meets these

conditions by setting the column FEEnrollment = 1.
•  Students are reported in the grade they are enrolled in on October 1st.

Page 154

•  For school level counts, include only serving schools that received a Report Card. For district level counts,

include all students served in a district.

•  For school and district level counts, if a student has a serving school of Category 9 - Vocational

Districts/Schools, then count them in their home school (school level counts) or home district (district level
counts).

•  All students, except private school students, should be counted at the state level.
•  The demographics come exclusively from the student demographic record as of the date of when the fall

enrollment snapshot is taken that is associated with the student unless otherwise documented.

o  Exception: The IEP flag checks the Pupil count snapshot from ISTAR.

•  “Student Enrollment” Total Count is defined as the Number of Students enrolled for a defined entity.
•  “Student Enrollment” Grade Level Count is defined as the Number of Students enrolled who belong to

each grade level between Pre-K and 12 for a defined entity.

•  “Student Enrollment” Grade Level Percentage is defined as the Percentage of Students enrolled who

belong to each grade level between Pre-K and 12 relative to the total enrollment of the entity in question.

•  The percentage of students belonging to a particular demographic group is calculated by dividing the

student count by demographic group by the total entity enrollment and multiplying the resulting quotient
by 100.

•  “Student Enrollment” is disaggregated by the following demographic groups:

o  All Students
o  Gender
o  Grade Levels
o  Race
o  Children with Disabilities (CWD)
o  Students with IEPs
o  English Learner
o  Former English Learner
o  Never English Learner
o  Low Income
o  Homeless
o  Migrant
o  Youth In Care
o  Military

English Learners (EL)
Definition
English learners (EL) are students who have been identified through a screening process as eligible for bilingual
education and/or English as a second language (ESL) services, and who have not yet reached English
proficiency, as measured by ACCESS for ELLs.

Guidance Citation
State Statute/Guidance: Illinois School Code 105 ILCS 5/Art. 14C
State Statute/Guidance: Illinois School Code  105 ILCS 5/1A-4E
Federal Statute/Guidance: USDE Office of Civil Rights

Business Rules
•  Annually, EL students are tested for English language proficiency by means of an ACCESS test.
•  Students remain ELs until they achieve a proficient overall composite score of 4.8 on the ACCESS test.
•  EL students additionally have an EL record.
•  The ALL EL student group is also the EL Student Group.
Include students from Kindergarten to 12th grade.
•

o

Identified Pre-K EL students participate in EL programs but they are excluded.

•  “English Learner Students” are indicated with an indicator in the Student Demographic record that is

maintained by SIS.

•  “EL Exit Student Count” is the number of students that achieved an Overall Composite performance score

greater than or equal to 4.8 in the current school year.

•  “EL Exit Rate” is the number of students that achieved an Overall Composite performance score greater

than or equal to 4.8 divided by the number of EL students that have a valid score.

•  “Number EL Students to take ACCESS” is the count of EL students that have a valid score, have a partial

score, or should have tested.

o  A “valid score” is an Overall composite scale score greater than or equal to 100 and less than or

equal to 600.

▪  This means having results for all four domains by satisfying the attemptedness criteria for
each of them.  These results would include, at least, a scale score and proficiency level.

o  A “partial score” is a student without an Overall composite score, but has a score in at least one of

the 4 domains

▪  Code 18 should be applied to these records

o  “Should have tested” includes all students with a code of 10, 15, or 19

▪  10 = Absent from Testing
▪  15 = Refusal but Present to Test
▪  19 = Reserved for Internal Use

•  “ACCESS Participation Rate” is the number of EL students with either a valid score or a partial score divided

by the sum of valid scores plus partial scores plus should have tested.

o  Note for ACCESS Participation Denominator

▪

▪

If multiple records exist with the same enrollment ID but there is no score for either
enrollment record, we will select a distinct record for the participation denominator
If multiple records exist with the same enrollment ID with a complete score but no score
record, we will select the enrollment record with score for participation denominator

•  “ACCESS Performance Levels” is the number of students by overall composite performance level.

o  Composite performance levels range from 1.0 to 6.0.

Page 160

▪  Use the composite performance score to map students to a performance level.

•  Level 1 is a score from 1.0 to 1.9
•  Level 2 is a score from 2.0 to 2.9
•  Level 3 is a score from 3.0 to 3.9
•  Level 4 is a score from 4.0 to 4.9
•  Level 5 is a score from 5.0 to 5.9
•  Level 6 is a score of 6.0

•  “Long Term EL” is the count of students who have been in an EL program for more than 7 years who have

not already reached proficiency, excluding kindergarten.

o  This is the count of students who are EL in the reporting year, are not proficient in the reporting

year and whose first EL record was before the school year - 6.

o  Count them long term even if they were not tested during the reporting year.
o  Use the last enrollment for the year to determine responsible school, district and if they are

reported at the state level.

•  Transition Status

o  Disaggregated by Chicago (CPS) 299 and Rest of the State (Non-CPS)
o  This metric will be reported based on the following:

▪  “Transitioned”

•  English Learners who attained English language proficiency as defined by the state (a
4.8 Overall Composite Proficiency Level on the ACCESS for ELLs measure). These
students are now prepared to be transitioned\integrated into general education
classes.

▪  “Not Transitioned”

•  English Learners who did not transition out of the program were promoted to the
next grade, retained in the same grade, graduated, transferred, dropped out, or
another outcome.

•  Outcome Status

o  Disaggregated by Chicago (CPS) 299 and Rest of the State (Non-CPS))
o  This metric will be reported based on the following:

▪  “Promoted” to next grade or “Otherwise Retained”

•  Promoted is SIS Exit Code 05
•  Retained is SIS Exit Code 12

▪  “Transferred”
•

Includes students transferred to another district (SIS Exit Code 02), home schooled
(SIS Exit Code 03), private schooled (SIS Exit Code 04), moved out of the United
States (SIS Exit Code 18), transfer to another public school district out of Illinois (SIS
Exit Code 19), transfer to another public school district in Illinois (SIS Exit Code 20).

▪  “Graduated”

•  SIS Exit Code 06

▪  “Dropped Out”

•

Includes students who dropped out (SIS Exit Code 09) or transferred to a GED
program (SIS Exit Code 10), or moved not known to be continuing (SIS Exit Code 11).

▪  “Other Outcomes”

•

Include death (SIS Exit Code 07), expulsion (SIS Exit Code 08), age out (SIS Exit Code
14), the certificate of completion (SIS Exit Code 15), victim of a violent crime (SIS Exit
Code 16), change in serving school or percent of day attended (SIS Exit Code 17).

•  A student will be considered an IEP student if:

o  Student was enrolled on October 1st in the serving school
o  The student is part of the I-Star Pupil Count (Child Count) snapshot (as of December 1st)
o  The student is not in Fund Code:

▪  L = Nonpublic Private School
▪  N = Nonpublic not receiving services
▪  P = Nonpublic Home Schooled
▪  U = Public School but not receiving services

•  Refer to the Responsible Entity rules for determining home school/serving school for these metrics
•  The Educational Environment is disaggregated into two groups (EE Group) which are:

o  Early Childhood
o  School Age

•  For each EE group, in Education Environment overall percentage calculation, the denominator is the total

student enrollment in their EE group.

•  For each EE group, in Education Environment by Race/Disability percentage calculations, calculate two

percentages using different denominators:

o  Percentage of students within the EE group by race/disability:  Denominator is the total student

enrollment in their EE group

o  Percentage of students within the EE group of the same race/disability by race/disability:

Denominator is the total student enrollment in their EE group of the same race/disability category.

Attendance
Definition
Total School Days is the total attendance days for student instruction for the school year based on the
information in the public school calendar application.

Student Attendance Rate is a weighted measure of the number of days present relative to the total number of
potential attendance days.

Chronic Truancy Rate is a measure that identifies the percentage of students that are identified as chronic
truants. Students are considered chronic truants if they are subject to compulsory school attendance and are
absent without valid cause, as defined in Section 26-2a of the School Code, from such attendance for 5
percent or more of the previous 180 regular attendance days.

Chronic Absentee Rate is a measure that identifies the percentage of students that are identified as chronically
absent. Absences that total 10% or more of school days of the most recent academic school year, including
absences with and without valid cause, as defined in Section 26-2a of this Code, and out-of-school suspensions
for an enrolled student.

Truancy Rate is a measure that identifies the percentage of students that are identified as truant. Students are
considered truant if they are subject to compulsory school attendance and are absent without valid cause, as
defined under this Section 5/26-2a, from such attendance for more than 1% but less than 5% of the past 180
school days.

•  Student Attendance Rate

o  Only students in grades K – 12 are counted for student attendance.
o  The student attendance rate is determined by dividing the sum of all student attendance days

present per school/districts/state by the sum of all attendance days present and non-attendance
days per school/districts/state and multiplying the resulting quotient by 100.

o  The sum of all student attendance days present is determined by adding together all the “In

Person”, “ELearning”, “Medically Homebound”, “Remote Learning”, and “Detention Center” per
student per school/district/state in SIS for grades 1 through 12.

o  Non-attendance days are “days absent – excused,” “days absent – unexcused”, “mental health”

and “hospitalized”.

o  Total attendance data for all student enrollments at the home school/home district.

Page 181

o  Do not include private school students
o  When calculating student attendance for the month of March, the maximum number of student

attendance days will not exceed 11

▪  This limitation will only be applied for the purposes of calculating metrics for the 2020

Report Card

▪  This limitation will not negatively or positively impact the ADA calculation

o

 If any student’s attendance is greater than 11, we will first reduce the number of days absent.  If
the student’s attendance is still greater than 11, we will then reduce the number of days present
until the student’s attendance equals 11.

•  Chronic Truancy Rate

o  Only students in grades 1 – 12 are counted for chronic truancy.
o  Do not include private school students
o  Do not include student enrollments that the Total Days Enrolled multiplied by Percent Day

Attended (PDA) associated with that enrollment at the home school is less than 21.

o  The chronic truancy rate is determined by dividing the number of chronically truant students per
school/district/state by the total number of students at the home school and multiplying the
resulting quotient by 100.

o  A student is “chronically truant” if they missed 5% or more of the time that they were enrolled

without an excuse.

▪  For every school/district/state, every student with at least one included enrollment is

counted.

▪  Unexcused Absences is calculated by counting the number of attendance days reported as

“Days Absent – Unexcused” per student.

▪  The Total Days Enrolled is calculated by counting the number of attendance days associated

with the student (In Person, ELearning, Remote Learning, Medically homebound,
Hospitalized, Mental Health, Detention Center, Days absent excused, and Days absent
unexcused).
If the sum of Unexcused Absences divided by the Total Days Enrolled is greater or equal to
0.05, then the student is considered chronically truant.

▪

▪  For students with multiple included enrollments at the same home school, Chronic Truancy
Rate is calculated with the sum of all Total Days Enrolled and the sum of all Unexcused
absence for all enrollments at the school.

•  Chronic Absentee Rate

o  Only students in grades K – 12 are counted for chronic absenteeism.
o  Do not include private school students.
o  Do not include student enrollments that the Total Days Enrolled multiplied by Percent Day

Attended (PSA) associated with that enrollment at the home school is less than 10.

o  Total Days Enrolled exclude Days Hospitalized and Medically Homebound.
o  The chronic absentee rate is determined by dividing the number of chronically absent students per
school/district/state by the total number of students and multiplying the resulting quotient by 100.

o  A student is “chronically absent” if they missed 10% or more of the school year regardless of

excuse.

▪  For every school/district/state, every student with at least one included enrollment of at

least 11 consecutive school days is counted.

▪  The Sum of Absences for chronic absenteeism is calculated by counting the number of
attendance days reported as “Days absent – unexcused”, “Days absent – excused” and
“Mental Health”. The Total Days Enrolled for chronic absenteeism is calculated by counting

Page 182

the number of attendance days reported as “Days in person”, “ELearning”, “Remote
Learning” , “Days absent unexcused” , “Days absent excused” , “Mental Health” and
“Detention Center”.
If the Sum of Absences divided by the Total Days Enrolled is greater than or equal to 0.10
then the student is considered chronically absent.

▪

▪  For students with multiple included enrollments at the same home school, attendance is

the sum of all days for the schools.

•  Truancy Rate
o
o  Only students in grades 1– 12 are counted for truancy rate.
o  Do not include private school students
o  Do not include student enrollments that the Total Days Enrolled multiplied by Percent Day

Attended (PDA) associated with that enrollment at the home school is less than 21.

o  The truancy rate is determined by dividing the number of truant students per school/district/state
by the total number of students at the home school and multiplying the resulting quotient by 100.

o  A student is “truant” if they missed more than 1% but less than 5% of the time that they were

enrolled without an excuse.

▪  For every school/district/state every student with at least one included enrollment at the

home school is counted.

▪  Unexcused Absences is calculated by counting the number of attendance days reported as

“Days Absent – Unexcused” per student.

▪  The Total Days Enrolled is calculated by counting the number of attendance days associated

with the student (In Person, ELearning, Remote Learning, Medically homebound,
Hospitalized, Mental Health, Detention Center, Days absent excused, and Days absent
unexcused).
If the sum of Unexcused Absences divided by the Total Days Enrolled is greater than 0.01
and less than 0.05, then the student is considered truant.

▪

▪  For students with multiple included enrollments at the same home school, Truancy Rate is
calculated with the sum of all Total Days Enrolled and the sum of all Unexcused absence for
the schools.

Student Mobility
Definition
Student mobility is the unduplicated count for students who transferred in and out of the serving school at
any time during the school year (October 1st – May 1st). It is the sum of the unduplicated students
who transferred in and transferred out for any reason, divided by the unduplicated counts of student enrolled
between October 1st and May 1st, multiplied by 100.

Transfers in, relative to student mobility, comprise all incidents of students being added to the enrollment
roster.

Transfers out, relative to student mobility, comprise all incidents of students being removed from the
enrollment roster for any reason. Students who exited due to graduation or receiving a certificate of
completion are excluded.

Federal Statute/Guidance: N/A

Business Rules
•  Mobility Rates are calculated separately at the school level, district level, and state level.
•  Students who have exited due to graduation (Code ‘06’) or by receiving a certificate of completion (Code

‘15’) are excluded from the calculation.

•  A student is considered mobile if they “transferred out” or “transferred in”:

o  Transferred out = The enrollment exited for any reason except Code ‘06’ or ‘15’ after October

1st but before May 1st

o  Transferred in = The enrollment began after October 1st but before May 1st

•  A student count is only counted once at the school, district, and state level for the school year.
•  Private school students are excluded.
•  The numerator is the count of unduplicated students who transferred out plus students who transferred

in.

•  The denominator is the unduplicated count of students enrolled between October 1st and May 1st

excluding enrollments exited with codes ‘06’, ‘15’, or private school students.

Formula (calculations)
Student Mobility Formula
•

(∑Unduplicated [(Students who transferred out) + (Students who transferred in)]) ÷ ((Unduplicated count
of students enrolled in entity between October 1st and May 1st)) × 100

•  At the state level, all counts/percentages should be based on unduplicated student counts

Dropout Rate
Definition
“Dropout Rate” is the rate of dropouts in an entity (school, district, state) per enrollment.  A dropout is
defined as a student who:
•  Was enrolled in school at some time during the school year, but was not enrolled the following school
year, and was expected to be in membership (i.e., were not reported as dropouts the year before),

•  Did not graduate from high school,
•  Did not complete a state or district-approved educational program, and
•  Did not meet any of the following exclusionary conditions:

o  Transfer to another public school district, private school, or state- or district-approved educational

program;

o  Temporary school-recognized absence due to suspension or illness; or
o  Death.

EdFact FS032 Dropout File Specifications  https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/eden/non-xml/fs032-
19-0.docx

Business Rules
•  A dropout is defined in the USDE FS032 file specifications for all student groups and also reported on the

Report Card.

•  The USDE FS009 file specifications defines dropout reporting requirements for Students with Disabilities

for the EdFacts report and the Special Education District and State Performance Profile.

o  Special Education will base their drop out definition on the Report Card definition as allowed by the

USDE guidelines.

•  A student’s last enrollment during the regular school year is the enrollment used to determine the home

school, grade and exit code.
Include all students whose last enrollment during the regular school year was in grade 9 or higher.

•

o  Do not include summer school enrollments.
o  Do not include private school students.

▪  “Private school student” includes non-public students enrolled to receive Special Education

services and those enrolled for a class/program like CTE or Drivers Ed.

•  The denominator is the count of the number of students whose last regular enrollment for the school year
was in grade 9 to 12 at the school/district plus the number of students from the previous year from the
same school/district who were expected to enroll this school year but did not enroll in an Illinois public
school district anywhere in the state.

•  A student is counted in the “dropout students for reporting year” group if the last enrollment for the

reporting school year has an exit type of:
o  Dropped Out (SIS Exit code = 09)
o  Transfer to GED program (SIS Exit code = 10)
o  Moved, not known to be continuing (SIS Exit code = 11)

•  A student is counted in the “prior year cohort not currently enrolled” group if there is no enrollment in any
district in Illinois in the reporting school year (based on fall enrollment in the Fall Enrollment and End of

Page 188

Year snapshot) and the last enrollment for the previous school year was in grade 9 to 12 and had an exit
type of:

o  Promotion (SIS Exit code = 05)
o  Retained in same grade (SIS Exit code = 12)
o  Change in Serving School or Full Time Equivalent (FTE) (SIS Exit code = 17)
o  Expulsion (SIS Exit code = 08)

•  Exit codes for high school students are from the updated exit code on the graduation cohort table. This will

allow districts that marked a student as dropout to change the exit code if they receive proof of a
transfer.

•  The grade level for the students that were expected to enroll in the current school year based on the prior

school year’s last enrollment is the prior school year grade plus 1 capped at 12th grade.

•  Based on these requirements the currently active student enrollment exit codes and the effect on the

dropout calculation are:

Title I Status

Page 203

Title I Status
Definition
Title I Status indicates if an entity receives a Title I grant allocation. If an entity receives a Title I allocation their
status can be "Title I Targeted", "Title I Schoolwide", Title I Eligible but Not Served”, or “Title I Ineligible Due to
Ranking”.
•  “Title I Targeted” assistance must focus services to identify students most at risk of failing through multiple

objective criteria. Services, including supplies, must focus on those students identified.

•  “Title I Schoolwide” may focus services to the entire school. Schoolwide Title I status is defined as schools
with students classified as low income, poverty percentage of 40% or greater.  A school that identifies as
“Schoolwide” is not required to identify at risk students and may focus their allocation and efforts on
increasing whole school academic achievement.

•  “Title I Eligible but Not Served” qualifies the school for Title I services but the district determines if the
attendance center 1) will not receive an allotment (non-Title I schools); 2) receives supplemental
allotments from other state and local funding streams; and 3) expends state and local funding equal to or
exceeding the allocation amount that would be provided under Title I.

•  “Title I Ineligible Due to Ranking” requires that a district rank and serve all attendance areas in poverty

order, highest to lowest. Schools may be deemed ineligible due to the poverty ranking criteria.

SY 2024

Page 205

Summative Designation Meta Indicator Components
Definition
The accountability system has four meta-indicators that are currently being validated for use as indicators.
These include the College and Career Readiness indicator (CCRI), Fine Arts indicator, P-2 indicator, and
Elementary/Middle indicator. For 2023 and going forward, the components of the CCRI and Fine Arts
indicators will be added to the report card. For 2024 and going forward, the components of the P-2 and
Elementary/Middle indicators will be added to the report card. For more information on the meta-indicators,
please see the Individual Indicators webpage.  We will not be reporting an overall calculation, but rather the
sub-elements. For more information on the meta-indicators, please see the Individual Indicators webpage.

•  CCRI Meta Indicator Components

o  For all of the following metrics the denominator is the number of students from the applicable
academic year with an exit code of graduated in a given home school, and the numerator is the
number of students from the denominator who have met the requirements of the metric (or that
fall within particular performance ranges, as applicable to the metric).

▪  Percentage of students with 95% attendance in JR/SR year (average of the two years must

be 95% or better)

▪  Percentage of students who fall into each GPA category
▪  Percentage of students who meet the IL SAT/ACT Composite Minimum requirement
▪  Percentage of students who have at least 1 Academic ELA Indicator
▪  Percentage of students who have at least 1 Academic Math Indicator
▪  Percentage of students who have identified a Career Area of Interest by Sophomore Year
▪  Percentage of students who have earned 1, 2, or 3+ career ready indicators
▪  Percentage of students who have earned a College and Career Pathway Endorsement

•  Fine Arts Meta Indicator Components

o  Student Participation in Fine Arts

▪  The non-duplicated count of all students who are enrolled in one or more fine arts courses
in a year, divided by the total number of students at the school. Inclusive of all grades,
including K.

o  Teacher Qualifications

▪  A school’s total number of students enrolled in one or more arts courses taught by a

qualified Illinois teacher divided by the school’s total number of students enrolled in one or
more arts courses.

•  P-2 Meta Indicator Components

o  Chronic Absenteeism

▪  The percentage of students in grades K, 1, and 2 who are chronically absent.

o  Dual Language

▪  The percentage of Currently EL or Currently EL Transition Incomplete K, 1st, and 2nd grade

students who are enrolled in a dual language program.

o  3rd Grade Literacy

▪  The percentage of 3rd grade students who have received an A, B, or C (or commensurate

standards) in ELA.

•  Elementary/Middle School Meta Indicator Components

o  5th Grade Math

▪  The percentage of 5th grade students who have received an A, B, or C (or commensurate

standards) in math.

o  Middle School Success Academic

Page 206

▪  The percentage of 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students who have received at least one A or B

(or commensurate standards) and no grade of D and F (or commensurate standards) in core
content courses in the current academic year.

o  Middle School Success Discipline

▪  The percentage of 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students who have received a suspension or

expulsion in the current academic year.

o  Percentage of students with 95% attendance in JR/SR year (average of the two years must be 95%

or better)

▪  Displayed as the percentage of students who met this requirement)
▪  Refer to the Report Card Student Attendance Rate Business Rules.
▪  As specified in 105 ILCS 5/19.05, “a day of attendance shall be counted only for sessions of

not less than 5 clock hours of school work per day.”

▪  Activities outlined in 105 ILCS 5/19.05 (k), including dual credit, Supervised Career

Development Experience, youth apprenticeship, and blended learning, count toward the
calculation of clock hours of school work per day.

▪  Local school boards determine a day for which students are receiving instruction as guided

by 105 ILCS 5/10-19.05.

▪  For the purposes of guidance, it may be helpful to utilize the opposite of attendance by

reviewing the definition of “truant” as defined in the School Code (105 ILCS 5/26-2a) “… as a
child subject to compulsory school attendance and who is absent without valid cause from
such attendance for a school day or portion thereof. ‘Valid cause’ for absence shall be
illness, observance of a religious holiday, death in the immediate family, family emergency,
and shall include such other situations beyond the control of the student as determined by
the board of education in each district, or such other circumstances which cause reasonable
concern to the parent for the safety or health of the student.”
ISBE uses attendance data currently entered into SIS by districts to calculate an average of
attendance junior and senior years for each student.

School Improvement In Arrears
Definition
IL-EMPOWER is a federal grant program authorized under Title I, Part A, Section 1003 of the Every Student
Succeeds Act, 2015 (ESSA).  The purpose of this School Improvement Grant is to support local education
agencies (LEA), via the Statewide System of Technical Assistance and Support (IL-EMPOWER) to serve schools
implementing comprehensive support and improvement activities or targeted support and improvement
activities.  The goal is to provide all children significant opportunity to receive a fair, equitable, and high-
quality education by providing adequate resources to substantially raise the achievement of students in lowest
and underperforming schools.

Business Rules
•  Teacher metric data is calculated from the Employment Information System (EIS) and the Educator

Licensure Information System (ELIS). All Educator metrics are calculated on the work location level. The
district is the district/parent of the working location.  If working location entityId is DistrictId (Categrory 2)
then working location entityId is used as district entityId.

•  All rate calculations are numerator ÷ denominator × 100 (rounded to 1 decimal point)
•  All averages are rounded to the nearest whole number
•  For school level, work locations (schools) that do not receive a report card are excluded from

all teacher metrics

•  For district level, include all schools in that district, regardless if the school receives a report card or

not

Page 232

•  For state level, include all schools and districts, regardless if the school receives a report card or not
•  Teacher metrics include all for Instructional, Resource and Special Education Educators unless otherwise

specified

•  “Teachers” are educators within the Employment Information System (EIS) defined by the following rules:

o  Has an active Employment record and associated Position and Working Location details.
o  The Position record is associated with the School Year to be calculated.
o  The position is categorized as “Instructional” according to the EIS data elements.

▪  Note: Position Codes of 209 and 210 are codes that are no longer a valid teacher position

codes.  There are no employees assigned to these codes after School Year 2017.

o  A Position Time Frame of either:

▪  1 – Regular School Year
▪  3 – Both
▪  Note: Starting in the 2015-2016 both are being transitioned out, however needs to be
included as not all records have been transitioned.  Summer School only teachers are
excluded.

•  A teacher is considered “retained” if they have any FTE value in the year in question and were in the

same work location and had an FTE =1 in the previous year.

o  Report teacher demographics using the most recent available data.

•  Position Details

o  Teacher FTE is determined by the following:

▪

If a district has submitted “Contract Override Days” for their EIS records then Teacher FTE is:
Percent Full time * (Days Paid / Contract Override Days for Full Time), otherwise

▪  Teacher FTE is: ((Percent Full time * Days Paid / Contract Days for Full Time or Contract Days

Override) )

o  Teacher FTE salary is determined by the following:
▪  Teacher’s base salary / Teacher FTE

o  Note Regarding Full Time vs Part Time and FTE:

▪  A teacher’s Full-time/Part-time distinction is submitted by the district at the positions level.
▪  An educator can occupy two different positions based on the Position Category Codes

(e.g. teacher and assistant principal) for the same district they would be considered a part
time teacher and a part time administrator. Each position’s “percent full time” would be
less than 100% and the total percent full time for both positions cannot exceed 100%.
▪  An educator can occupy one position based on the Position Category Code (e.g. Teacher)

and be assigned to multiple work locations. The FTE is determined at the position level and
the work location FTE is determined by multiplying the work location “workload” value by
the position FTE.
If an educator holds the same position at multiple employers (district) the educator’s FTE is
determined at each employer.

▪

•  Work Location Details

o  All teacher/educator metrics are calculated on the work location level.
o  A teacher can have more than one work location associated with an EIS Position.
o  Each working location detail:

Identifies the physical location / school the teacher assigned to.

▪
▪  The district is determined by the parent entity of the working location/school.
▪

Includes the Workload which represents the amount of time the teacher is at the location.

Page 233

o  Work Location Teacher FTE is the percent of their EIS Position Full-Time Equivalent value they are

allocated to that work location or workload * position FTE.

o  The school used for High Poverty / Low Poverty is the serving school from the enrollments as it

matches the teacher working location.

▪  Determination of High Poverty and Low Poverty schools occurs via a separate process

outside the Teacher metric calculation counting the years a teacher appears in EIS with an
FTE >= 0.67 and adding that to the sum of experience from the retired TSR system.

•

Illinois in-state Teacher Experience is determined by summing the years of experience a teacher has in
EIS and adding that to the sum of experience from the retired TSR system.

•  Teachers with Gifted Endorsement are teachers who have at least one of the following License

Endorsement with an issued status:
o  GIED (Gifted Education)

Business Rules
•  All rate calculations are numerator ÷ denominator × 100 (rounded to 1 decimal point).
•  All averages are rounded to the nearest whole number.
•  For school level, work locations (schools) that do not receive a report card are excluded from

all administrator metrics.

•  All Educator metrics are calculated on the work location level.  The district is the district/parent of the

working location.  If Working location entity is district (Category 2) then working location entity is used to
as district entity.

•  For district level, include all schools in that district, regardless if the school receives a report card or not
•  For state level, include all schools and districts, regardless if the school receives a report card or not
•  Principal Turnover at the school level is reported as a count, but at the district and state level, it is reported

as an average.
Identifying Metric Groups

•

o  Has an active Employment record and associated Position and Working Location details.
o  The Position record is associated with the School Year to be calculated.
o  The Position Time Frame is:

▪  1 - Regular School Year
▪  3 - Both
▪  Note: Starting in the 2015-2016 both are being transitioned out, however needs to be

included as not all records have been transitioned. Summer School only administrators are
excluded.

o  An Administrator is identified in the Employee Information System (EIS) as:

▪  The position has Position Category of:

•  Administrative
•  Excluding ROEs (ISBE Funded Assignments) Position Codes of:

Page 257

o  122 – Regional Superintendent
o  123 – Assistant Regional Superintendent
o  A Certified Staff member is identified in the Employee Information System (EIS) as:

▪  Have an active Employment record and associated Position and Working Location details.
▪  The Position record is associated with the School Year to be calculated.
▪  The Position Category is one of the following:

•  Administrative
•
Instructional
•  Ancillary Staff
•  Excluding ROEs (ISBE Funded Codes) Position Codes of:

o  122 – Regional Superintendent
o  123 – Assistant Regional Superintendent

o  A Principal is identified in the Employee Information System (EIS) as:

▪  Those with a Position Code of:
•  103 – Principal

o  A Support Personnel member is identified in the Employee Information System (EIS) as:

▪  Those with a Position Code of:
•  372 – School Counselor
•  374 – School Nurse
•  377 – School Psychologist
•  379 – School Social Worker

•  Position Details

o  The following are collected at the Position level, which are utilized to calculate a Full-Time

Equivalent (FTE) value for that position and is the value utilized to calculate their FTE Salary:

▪  Salary
▪  Percent Full Time

o  Position FTE is determined by the following:

▪

IF a district has submitted “Contract Override Days” for their EIS records then Position FTE
is: Percent Full time * (Days Paid / Contract Override Days for Full Time), otherwise

▪  Position FTE is: Percent Full time * (Days Paid / Contract Days for Full Time)

o  Position FTE salary is determined by the following:

▪  Base salary / Position FTE

o  Note Regarding Full Time vs Part Time and FTE:

▪  A position’s Full-time /Part-time distinction is submitted by the district at the positions
level. An educator can occupy two different positions based on the Position Codes
(e.g. teacher and assistant principal) for the same district – they would be considered a part
time teacher and a part time administrator. Each position’s “percent full time” would be
less than 100% and the total percent full time for both positions cannot exceed 100%.
▪  An educator can occupy one position based on the Position Code (e.g. Principal) and be
assigned to multiple work locations. The FTE is determined at the position level and the
work location FTE is determined by multiplying the work location “workload” value by the
position FTE.
If an educator holds the same position at multiple employers (district) the educator’s FTE is
determined at each employer.

▪

•  Work Location Details

Page 258

o  All Administrator and Certified Staff metrics are calculated based on the work location / school of

the administrator.

o  An Administrator and Certified Staff can have more than one work location associated with an EIS

Position.

o  Each Working Location detail:

Identifies the physical location / school the individual is assigned to.

▪

Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)
Definition
The Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a biennial (i.e., every other school year) survey of public schools
required by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) Office for Civil Rights since 1968. The CRDC collects data on
leading civil rights indicators related to access and barriers to educational opportunity at the early childhood
through Grade 12 levels. The CRDC collects data from public Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) and schools,
including juvenile facilities, charter schools, alternative schools, and schools serving only students with
disabilities.
