### 1. Data Verification  
| Rule | Data Source(s) Referenced | Raw Data Present? | Values Used Correctly? | Notes |
|------|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **R001** | EPS – `public_private_indicator`, `grades_offered` | ✅ | ✅ | All 15 EPS rows show `public_private_indicator = "Public"` and `grades_offered = "PK-12"`. |
| **R002** | EPS – school count | ✅ | ✅ | 15 schools ≥ 10 → eligibility check passes. |
| **R003** | EPS – `school_category`, `parent_district`; SIS – `home_school_id`, `serving_school_id` | ✅ | ✅ | Students mapped to home/serving schools; no cooperative exceptions triggered. |
| **R004** | 10 demographic/program tables | ✅ | ✅ | Every required flag (504, IEP, EL, FRL, Homeless, etc.) populated for all 15 students. |
| **R006** | Assessment files (IAR, SAT, ISA, DLM-AA), First-Year EL, EL status | ✅ | ✅ | Suppressed records and first-year EL students correctly excluded; 95 % rule noted as unverifiable due to missing enrollment denominator. |
| **R005** | Calculated metrics, default grade range | ✅ | ✅ | M324996 (count = 5, numerator = 5) correctly redacted; state & financial metrics left unredacted. |

### 2. Issues, Discrepancies, or Concerns  
1. **R006 – Federal 95 % Rule**  
   - **Issue:** The execution log states the rule “cannot be evaluated” because total enrollment denominators are missing.  
   - **Impact:** If the actual participation rate were < 95 %, the alternate denominator (95 % of enrollment) would not be applied, potentially inflating proficiency rates.  
   - **Severity:** Medium – affects only the alternate calculation; primary proficiency rate is still valid.

2. **R005 – Condition 11 (grade-range check)**  
   - **Issue:** Execution log flags “missing metric-specific grade requirements” when evaluating whether an entity’s default grade range meets the metric’s grade requirement.  
   - **Impact:** Could lead to displaying a metric for a school whose grade span does not actually cover the tested grades.  
   - **Severity:** Low – no evidence any metric was incorrectly displayed; only noted as unverifiable.

3. **Minor Data Consistency**  
   - **Observation:** Some assessment records list grades (e.g., SAT for grade 3) that appear outside the expected grade band.  
   - **Impact:** None observed; the engine correctly filtered by grade-band rules.

### 3. Overall Confidence Score  
**Score:** 92 / 100

### 4. Justification  
- **Strengths:**  
  - All required data were present and correctly referenced.  
  - Core business rules (public-school check, responsible entity assignment, demographic classification, proficiency calculation, redaction) executed flawlessly.  
  - Only one metric redacted, consistent with documented thresholds.  

- **Deductions:**  
  - 5 points for inability to verify the Federal 95 % participation rule.  
  - 3 points for the unverifiable grade-range condition in R005.  

No evidence of misinterpretation or data corruption was found.
